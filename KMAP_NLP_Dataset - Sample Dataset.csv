xfan,xfan's biography,"Dr. Fan is an observational cosmologist. The research of his group aims at answering questions such as: When did the first luminous objects appear in the Universe? How did the first generations of galaxies and quasars heat up the intergalactic gas, re-ionize the Universe and end the cosmic dark ages? He has pioneered techniques to search for the most distant quasars in the early universe, at z>6. Using these quasars, he has shown that supermassive black holes with masses up to 10 million solar masses existed within one billion years after the big bang. Meanwhile, the absorption spectra of these quasars reveal a rapid increase in cold atomic gas in the intergalactic medium, marking the end of reionziation epoch at z~6. His group is currently involved in conducting new surveys of quasars at z>7 using new near-IR large sky surveys, and studies of the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies in the early universe with facilities such as ALMA and HST. He is also involved in studying spectroscopic properties of the first generation galaxies that are responsible to reionization, using LBT, HST, and soon with JWST. In addition, he is working on a project called ""MAMMOTH"", a novel survey of the most massive large scale structure and protocluster environments at the peak of cosmic star formation.",xfan's articles,"Dr. Fan is an observational cosmologist.

dfz,dfz's biography,"Prof. Zaritsky, in collaboration with UA graduate student Jennifer Kadowaki and researcher Richard Donnerstein, is undertaking a large program to survey nearly a third of the sky for ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The largest of these galaxies appear to be analogs to the Milky Way galaxy that have only formed 1% as many stars. As such, they are dark matter dominated at all radii and provide the first known examples of dark matter halos that have total masses of 10^12 solar masses and which have been relatively undisturbed by baryonic processes. The program involves using the DESI preimaging data to identify candidates and then various techniques to estimate or measure redshifts. So far, they have used the Large Binocular Telescope to produce the largest spectroscopically confirmed sample of UDGs. Zaritsky is proposing to dedicate a 2-m telescope with an integral field spectrograph for a large spectroscopic survey of UDGs. Ultimately, binary UDGs will be used to test the structure of dark matter halos.",dfz's articles,"Prof. Zaritsky, in collaboration with UA graduate student Jennifer Kadowaki and researcher Richard Donnerstein, is undertaking a large program to survey nearly a third of the sky for ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs).

killgore,killgore's biography,"Dr. Killgore's research has emphasized the study of higher order cognition and executive functions and how these cognitive abilities are influenced and guided by subtle affective processes. Recent sleep-related research has focused on the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and the use of stimulant countermeasures on the cognitive-affective systems within the brain. This line of investigation suggests that sleep deprivation alters the metabolic activity within several important affect-regulating regions of the brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex, resulting in subtle but profound effects on specific aspects of affect and cognition. These changes appear to impair the ability to use affective processes to guide judgment and decision-making, particularly in high-risk or emotionally charged morally relevant situations. His recent investigations also suggest that while commonly used stimulants such as caffeine, modafinil, and dextroamphetamine are highly effective at reversing sleep-loss induced deficits in alertness and vigilance, their restorative effects on the cognitive-affective decision-making systems of the brain may be much more limited.",killgore's articles,"Dr. Killgore's research has emphasized the study of higher order cognition and executive functions and how these cognitive abilities are influenced and guided by subtle affective processes.

rjsimpson,rjsimpson's biography,"Dr. Simpson completed his training in exercise physiology and immunology at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland before spending nine years as a faculty member at the University of Houston. He studies the effects of exercise and stress on the immune system. Major cross-cutting themes of his work are aging (immunosenescence), cancer and spaceflight. Specifically, Dr Simpson and his team study how single exercise bouts can be used to augment the recovery and expansion of specific immune cells that can be used therapeutically to treat patients with hematologic malignancies; and how exercise can be used to negate the onset of immunosenescence during natural aging. He is also interested in how exercise training can contribute to improved patient survival and quality of life through immune and inflammatory pathways at all phases of the cancer care continuum. His current work includes four NASA funded projects that aim to examine the impact of long duration spaceflight and extreme isolation on astronaut immune function and illness rates, and the effects of simulated microgravity on viral infectivity and host immune evasion. Dr. Simpson is also investigating how certain viral infections can protect patients from relapse following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a project that has been funded by the National Cancer Institute.

granzier,granzier's biography,"Hendrikus Granzier, PhD, studies the mechanisms whereby the giant filamentous protein titin (the largest protein known) influence muscle structure and function. His lab has shown that titin functions as a molecular spring that mediates acute responses to changing pathophysiological states of the heart. They also study the role of titin in cardiac disease, using mouse models with specific modifications in the titin gene, including deciphering the mechanisms that are responsible for gender differences in diastolic dysfunction. An additional focus of Dr. Granzier’s lab is on nebulin, a major muscle protein that causes a severe skeletal muscle disease in humans. Based on previous work, they hypothesize that nebulin is a determinant of calcium sensitivity of contractile force. To test this and other concepts, he uses a nebulin knockout approach in the mouse. Research is multi-faceted and uses cutting-edge techniques at levels ranging across the single molecule, single cell, muscle, and the intact heart.

kkpapas,kkpapas's biography,"Dr. Papas has worked on the development and validation of equipment and assays (especially ones based on mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rate, OCR) for the real-time, objective assessment of islet (and other cell and tissue) quality prior to transplantation. The OCR assay has been validated based on its ability to predict diabetes reversal in rodents and clinical human islet allo transplants in patients with Type 1 Diabetes as well as islet auto transplants in patients with chronic pancreatitis. He utilized these assays along with engineering principles to optimize critical steps in the islet transplantation process. These steps include pancreas procurement, pancreas preservation, islet isolation and purification, islet culture and shipment and islet transplantation and engraftment in the recipient. He is also involved through NIH funding in research seeking improvement in organ preservation technology to extend the time window from procurement to transplantation and the use of organs from expanded-criteria donors without compromising clinical outcomes. A major focus of his current research, which is sponsored by the JDRF Encapsulation Consortium and the NIH NIDDK, is the successful clinical transplantation of islets or stem-cell derived β-cells to reverse diabetes without the need for immunosuppression. His work focuses on the optimization of β-cell viability and function post-transplantation by improving oxygenation. He utilizes novel methods for in situ oxygen delivery [via a miniaturized wearable and ultimately fully implantable (size of a few pennies), electrochemical oxygen generators] to retrievable vascularization inducing macro-encapsulation immunoisolation devices. Enhanced oxygenation to such immunoisolation devices in vivo can: 1) dramatically reduce the necessary size from that of a 40” flat-screen TV to that of a postage stamp); 2) enhance beta cell functionality (in terms of glucose-stimulated secretion within them); and 3) reduce the dose of cells required to reverse diabetes. If successfully translated to the clinic, his work in this area has the potential to have a profound impact on reducing overall costs, increasing availability, and improving short-and long-term outcomes of β-cell therapies for the treatment of diabetes while eliminating the need for immunosuppression.",kkpapas's articles,"Dr. Papas has worked on the development and validation of equipment and assays (especially ones based on mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rate, OCR) for the real-time, objective assessment of islet (and other cell and tissue) quality prior to transplantation.

The Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology we have been developing, known as the R_h=ct Universe, has thus far been favoured over the current standard model by over 25 such measurements, promising to simply and elegantly resolve long-standing puzzles, such as the nature of cosmological redshift (i.e., whether it is, or is not, merely the conventional lapse function in general relativity), the CMB temperature and electroweak horizon problems in the early Universe, and the (apparently) premature formation of galaxies and quasars at z>6. This investigation draws heavily from ongoing work with general relativity and its application to black-hole systems including, and especially, the supermassive object (known as Sagittarius A*) at the Galactic center.

lxc,lxc's biography,"Xianchun Li, PhD, is interested in understanding the physiological, biochemical, molecular and evolutionary bases of fundamental processes in the life history of insects such as embryonic polarity, metamorphosis, developmental commitment, host usage and environmental adaptation. One focus of his research is to elucidate the reciprocal signaling interactions between plants and insects, and the resulted on-going defense (in the case of plants) / counterdefense (in the case of herbivorous insects) phenotypic arm race over ecological time scale, with emphasis on the genetic machinery that percepts and transduces the reciprocal cues into genome and regulate defense / counterdefense phenotypes. Working systems include Helicoverpa zea, the corn earworm, a polyphagous noctuide of economic importance, and Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, a model organism. State of arts and traditional techniques are combining to identify the cues and to uncover the signaling transduction cascade that links environmental cues, gene expression and the resulted defense/counterdefense phenotypes. This research may lead to characterization of genes for designing new insecticides and/or genetically modifying crops. The second focus of Dr. Li’s research is to define, globally, the regulatory triangle between nuclear receptors (NRs), their ligands, and cytochrome P450s (P450s) in Drosophila melanogaster. Nuclear receptors (NRs) constitute a transcription factor superfamily that has evolved to sense and bind endogenous (e.g., hormones) and/or exogenous (e.g., naturally-occurring or synthetic xenobiotics) signal compounds, resulting in differential expression of particular target genes, which underlies a range of fundamental biological processes, including growth, development, reproduction, behavior, host usage, and environmental adaptation. Many of those cue chemicals, namely NR ligands, are synthesized and/or metabolized by members of the P450s gene superfamily, whose expression may be regulated by certain NRs. Bioinformatics analyses as well as systematic functional genomic techniques such as microarray, X-ChIP, mutation and ectopic expression will be combined to define the genome-wide regulatory interaction loops between NRs and P450s as well as to assign, at least partially, functions of individual NRs and P450s in the life history of fruit fly. Given the evolutionary conservations of homologous NRs and P450s between vertebrates and invertebrates, the results obtained in this project are expected to provide insights into the reciprocal regulatory interactions between NRs and P450s in other animals including humans as well as to provide great insights into new avenue for human NR ligand identification and NR-related drug design. The third focus of his research is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Bt and conventional insecticide resistance, which is a major threat in current IPM system. In collaboration with Dr. Bruce Tabashnik, Timothy Dennehy, and Yves Carriere in our Department, Dr. Li is going to compare Bt toxin binding affinity and other defects of natural (s, r1, r2, r3) and artificial mutant PBW (Pink Bollworm) cadherin proteins and thus define the key functional domains of PBW cadherin.",lxc's articles,"Xianchun Li, PhD, is interested in understanding the physiological, biochemical, molecular and evolutionary bases of fundamental processes in the life history of insects such as embryonic polarity, metamorphosis, developmental commitment, host usage and environmental adaptation.

secomb,secomb's biography,"Timothy Secomb, PhD, studies the microcirculation, a network of extremely small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to all parts of our tissues. The focus of work in his research group is the use of mathematical and computational approaches to study blood flow and mass transport in the microcirculation. Working in collaboration with experimentalists, the aim is to understand quantitatively the processes involved. Dr. Secomb examines the relationship between red blood cell mechanics and flow resistance in microvessels. Theoretical predictions agree well with observations in glass tubes, but resistance is higher living tissue. The major cause is the presence of a relatively thick macromolecular lining (endothelial surface layer) on the walls of microvessels. He also simulates oxygen exchange between networks of microvessels and surrounding tissues in skeletal muscle and tumors. In skeletal muscle, oxygen can be exchanged diffusively between arterioles and capillaries, and Dr. Secomb’s lab is studying the determinants of maximal oxygen consumption. In tumors, the relationship between network structure and occurrence of local hypoxic (radiation-resistant) regions is a source of curiosity. They are analyzing the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor tissues, and developing improved models to describe the responses of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Models for the structural responses of microvessels to functional demands are being developed. Maintenance of a stable, functionally adequate distribution of vessel diameters can be achieved if each vessel responds to changes in wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and local metabolic conditions, and if mechanisms exist for information transfer upstream and downstream along flow pathways. Models for the active regulation of blood flow by changes in vascular tone are also being developed, taking into account vascular responses to wall shear stress, pressure and local metabolic state, and including effects of conducted responses along vessel walls. Another project in the group is the development of computer simulations for the dynamics of the left ventricle that can be run in real time and provide a tool for analysis of data derived from ultrasound echocardiography images.",secomb's articles,"Timothy Secomb, PhD, studies the microcirculation, a network of extremely small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to all parts of our tissues.

jmerchant,jmerchant's biography,"Sonic Hedgehog and Gastric Cancer. Studies from my lab focus on the role of bacterial colonization and the development of type B chronic atrophic gastritis in a mouse model. Chronic atrophic gastritis is a precursor lesion in the development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer. We found that the gastrin-deficient mice, which are hypochlorhydric, develop antral gastric tumors within 9 –12 months of age. The tumors appear to be dependent on the microflora. Gastric atrophy exemplified by loss of the acid-secreting parietal cell precedes tumor development as observed in human subjects. We found that Helicobacter infection coincides with acute secretion of Shh from the parietal cells then eventually reduced Shh expression prior to parietal cell atrophy. Apparently pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1b, are sufficient to suppress parietal cell acid secretion and Shh gene expression (Waghray, M et al, Gastroenterology 2010). We showed that gastric acid stimulates Shh gene expression through calcium-mediated PKC activation (El-Zataari, M, Gastroenterology, 2010). During infection by Helicobacter, Gli1+immune cells are recruited to the stomach and over time change their phenotype from pro-inflammatory to immune-suppressive by becoming myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The switch to an immune-suppressive phenotype triggers the epithelium to become metaplastic (El-Zaatari et al., PloS One, 2013; Ding L et al. J Clinical Invest., 2016; Merchant, JL and Ding L, CMGH 2017).",jmerchant's articles,"Sonic Hedgehog and Gastric Cancer.
