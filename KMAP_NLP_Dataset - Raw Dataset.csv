xfan,"Dr. Fan is an observational cosmologist. The research of his group aims at answering questions such as: When did the first luminous objects appear in the Universe? How did the first generations of galaxies and quasars heat up the intergalactic gas, re-ionize the Universe and end the cosmic dark ages? He has pioneered techniques to search for the most distant quasars in the early universe, at z>6. Using these quasars, he has shown that supermassive black holes with masses up to 10 million solar masses existed within one billion years after the big bang. Meanwhile, the absorption spectra of these quasars reveal a rapid increase in cold atomic gas in the intergalactic medium, marking the end of reionziation epoch at z~6. His group is currently involved in conducting new surveys of quasars at z>7 using new near-IR large sky surveys, and studies of the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies in the early universe with facilities such as ALMA and HST. He is also involved in studying spectroscopic properties of the first generation galaxies that are responsible to reionization, using LBT, HST, and soon with JWST. In addition, he is working on a project called ""MAMMOTH"", a novel survey of the most massive large scale structure and protocluster environments at the peak of cosmic star formation.","Dr. Fan is an observational cosmologist.

dfz,"Prof. Zaritsky, in collaboration with UA graduate student Jennifer Kadowaki and researcher Richard Donnerstein, is undertaking a large program to survey nearly a third of the sky for ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The largest of these galaxies appear to be analogs to the Milky Way galaxy that have only formed 1% as many stars. As such, they are dark matter dominated at all radii and provide the first known examples of dark matter halos that have total masses of 10^12 solar masses and which have been relatively undisturbed by baryonic processes. The program involves using the DESI preimaging data to identify candidates and then various techniques to estimate or measure redshifts. So far, they have used the Large Binocular Telescope to produce the largest spectroscopically confirmed sample of UDGs. Zaritsky is proposing to dedicate a 2-m telescope with an integral field spectrograph for a large spectroscopic survey of UDGs.

killgore,"Dr. Killgore's research has emphasized the study of higher order cognition and executive functions and how these cognitive abilities are influenced and guided by subtle affective processes. Recent sleep-related research has focused on the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and the use of stimulant countermeasures on the cognitive-affective systems within the brain. This line of investigation suggests that sleep deprivation alters the metabolic activity within several important affect-regulating regions of the brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex, resulting in subtle but profound effects on specific aspects of affect and cognition. These changes appear to impair the ability to use affective processes to guide judgment and decision-making, particularly in high-risk or emotionally charged morally relevant situations. His recent investigations also suggest that while commonly used stimulants such as caffeine, modafinil, and dextroamphetamine are highly effective at reversing sleep-loss induced deficits in alertness and vigilance, their restorative effects on the cognitive-affective decision-making systems of the brain may be much more limited.","Dr. Killgore's research has emphasized the study of higher order cognition and executive functions and how these cognitive abilities are influenced and guided by subtle affective processes.

rjsimpson,"Dr. Simpson completed his training in exercise physiology and immunology at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland before spending nine years as a faculty member at the University of Houston. He studies the effects of exercise and stress on the immune system. Major cross-cutting themes of his work are aging (immunosenescence), cancer and spaceflight. Specifically, Dr Simpson and his team study how single exercise bouts can be used to augment the recovery and expansion of specific immune cells that can be used therapeutically to treat patients with hematologic malignancies; and how exercise can be used to negate the onset of immunosenescence during natural aging. He is also interested in how exercise training can contribute to improved patient survival and quality of life through immune and inflammatory pathways at all phases of the cancer care continuum. His current work includes four NASA funded projects that aim to examine the impact of long duration spaceflight and extreme isolation on astronaut immune function and illness rates, and the effects of simulated microgravity on viral infectivity and host immune evasion. Dr. Simpson is also investigating how certain viral infections can protect patients from relapse following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a project that has been funded by the National Cancer Institute.

granzier,"Hendrikus Granzier, PhD, studies the mechanisms whereby the giant filamentous protein titin (the largest protein known) influence muscle structure and function. His lab has shown that titin functions as a molecular spring that mediates acute responses to changing pathophysiological states of the heart. They also study the role of titin in cardiac disease, using mouse models with specific modifications in the titin gene, including deciphering the mechanisms that are responsible for gender differences in diastolic dysfunction. An additional focus of Dr. Granzier’s lab is on nebulin, a major muscle protein that causes a severe skeletal muscle disease in humans. Based on previous work, they hypothesize that nebulin is a determinant of calcium sensitivity of contractile force. To test this and other concepts, he uses a nebulin knockout approach in the mouse. Research is multi-faceted and uses cutting-edge techniques at levels ranging across the single molecule, single cell, muscle, and the intact heart.

kkpapas,"Dr. Papas has worked on the development and validation of equipment and assays (especially ones based on mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rate, OCR) for the real-time, objective assessment of islet (and other cell and tissue) quality prior to transplantation. The OCR assay has been validated based on its ability to predict diabetes reversal in rodents and clinical human islet allo transplants in patients with Type 1 Diabetes as well as islet auto transplants in patients with chronic pancreatitis. He utilized these assays along with engineering principles to optimize critical steps in the islet transplantation process. These steps include pancreas procurement, pancreas preservation, islet isolation and purification, islet culture and shipment and islet transplantation and engraftment in the recipient. He is also involved through NIH funding in research seeking improvement in organ preservation technology to extend the time window from procurement to transplantation and the use of organs from expanded-criteria donors without compromising clinical outcomes. A major focus of his current research, which is sponsored by the JDRF Encapsulation Consortium and the NIH NIDDK, is the successful clinical transplantation of islets or stem-cell derived β-cells to reverse diabetes without the need for immunosuppression. His work focuses on the optimization of β-cell viability and function post-transplantation by improving oxygenation. He utilizes novel methods for in situ oxygen delivery [via a miniaturized wearable and ultimately fully implantable (size of a few pennies), electrochemical oxygen generators] to retrievable vascularization inducing macro-encapsulation immunoisolation devices. Enhanced oxygenation to such immunoisolation devices in vivo can: 1) dramatically reduce the necessary size from that of a 40” flat-screen TV to that of a postage stamp); 2) enhance beta cell functionality (in terms of glucose-stimulated secretion within them); and 3) reduce the dose of cells required to reverse diabetes. If successfully translated to the clinic, his work in this area has the potential to have a profound impact on reducing overall costs, increasing availability, and improving short-and long-term outcomes of β-cell therapies for the treatment of diabetes while eliminating the need for immunosuppression.","Dr. Papas has worked on the development and validation of equipment and assays (especially ones based on mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rate, OCR) for the real-time, objective assessment of islet (and other cell and tissue) quality prior to transplantation.

One exciting area of research is screening/developing drugs that target Nrf2 for cancer prevention/intervention. The Zhang team has discovered many small-molecules that activate Nrf2 and are effective for chemoprevention. On the other hand, the lab is investigating the “darkside” of Nrf2 in cancer. Her group demonstrated that hyperactivation of Nrf2 also contributes to chemoresistance, cancer progression and metastasis. Therefore, the team is currently developing Nrf2 inhibitors with the hope that someday these compounds will be used therapeutically to improve cancer treatment.","Projects with cancer focus includes Nrf2 regulation and the role of NRF2 in cancer (lung, colon, liver and skin), utilizing many gene-specific knockout mice or transgenic mice/cell lines.

lxc,"Xianchun Li, PhD, is interested in understanding the physiological, biochemical, molecular and evolutionary bases of fundamental processes in the life history of insects such as embryonic polarity, metamorphosis, developmental commitment, host usage and environmental adaptation. One focus of his research is to elucidate the reciprocal signaling interactions between plants and insects, and the resulted on-going defense (in the case of plants) / counterdefense (in the case of herbivorous insects) phenotypic arm race over ecological time scale, with emphasis on the genetic machinery that percepts and transduces the reciprocal cues into genome and regulate defense / counterdefense phenotypes. Working systems include Helicoverpa zea, the corn earworm, a polyphagous noctuide of economic importance, and Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, a model organism. State of arts and traditional techniques are combining to identify the cues and to uncover the signaling transduction cascade that links environmental cues, gene expression and the resulted defense/counterdefense phenotypes. This research may lead to characterization of genes for designing new insecticides and/or genetically modifying crops. The second focus of Dr. Li’s research is to define, globally, the regulatory triangle between nuclear receptors (NRs), their ligands, and cytochrome P450s (P450s) in Drosophila melanogaster. Nuclear receptors (NRs) constitute a transcription factor superfamily that has evolved to sense and bind endogenous (e.g., hormones) and/or exogenous (e.g., naturally-occurring or synthetic xenobiotics) signal compounds, resulting in differential expression of particular target genes, which underlies a range of fundamental biological processes, including growth, development, reproduction, behavior, host usage, and environmental adaptation. Many of those cue chemicals, namely NR ligands, are synthesized and/or metabolized by members of the P450s gene superfamily, whose expression may be regulated by certain NRs. Bioinformatics analyses as well as systematic functional genomic techniques such as microarray, X-ChIP, mutation and ectopic expression will be combined to define the genome-wide regulatory interaction loops between NRs and P450s as well as to assign, at least partially, functions of individual NRs and P450s in the life history of fruit fly. Given the evolutionary conservations of homologous NRs and P450s between vertebrates and invertebrates, the results obtained in this project are expected to provide insights into the reciprocal regulatory interactions between NRs and P450s in other animals including humans as well as to provide great insights into new avenue for human NR ligand identification and NR-related drug design. The third focus of his research is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Bt and conventional insecticide resistance, which is a major threat in current IPM system. In collaboration with Dr. Bruce Tabashnik, Timothy Dennehy, and Yves Carriere in our Department, Dr. Li is going to compare Bt toxin binding affinity and other defects of natural (s, r1, r2, r3) and artificial mutant PBW (Pink Bollworm) cadherin proteins and thus define the key functional domains of PBW cadherin.","Xianchun Li, PhD, is interested in understanding the physiological, biochemical, molecular and evolutionary bases of fundamental processes in the life history of insects such as embryonic polarity, metamorphosis, developmental commitment, host usage and environmental adaptation.

secomb,"Timothy Secomb, PhD, studies the microcirculation, a network of extremely small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to all parts of our tissues. The focus of work in his research group is the use of mathematical and computational approaches to study blood flow and mass transport in the microcirculation. Working in collaboration with experimentalists, the aim is to understand quantitatively the processes involved. Dr. Secomb examines the relationship between red blood cell mechanics and flow resistance in microvessels. Theoretical predictions agree well with observations in glass tubes, but resistance is higher living tissue. The major cause is the presence of a relatively thick macromolecular lining (endothelial surface layer) on the walls of microvessels. He also simulates oxygen exchange between networks of microvessels and surrounding tissues in skeletal muscle and tumors. In skeletal muscle, oxygen can be exchanged diffusively between arterioles and capillaries, and Dr. Secomb’s lab is studying the determinants of maximal oxygen consumption. In tumors, the relationship between network structure and occurrence of local hypoxic (radiation-resistant) regions is a source of curiosity. They are analyzing the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor tissues, and developing improved models to describe the responses of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Models for the structural responses of microvessels to functional demands are being developed. Maintenance of a stable, functionally adequate distribution of vessel diameters can be achieved if each vessel responds to changes in wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and local metabolic conditions, and if mechanisms exist for information transfer upstream and downstream along flow pathways. Models for the active regulation of blood flow by changes in vascular tone are also being developed, taking into account vascular responses to wall shear stress, pressure and local metabolic state, and including effects of conducted responses along vessel walls. Another project in the group is the development of computer simulations for the dynamics of the left ventricle that can be run in real time and provide a tool for analysis of data derived from ultrasound echocardiography images.","Timothy Secomb, PhD, studies the microcirculation, a network of extremely small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to all parts of our tissues.

For the past 25 years her laboratory has been consistently funded by the National Cancer Institute to study the molecular basis of mutagenesis and dysfunctional DNA repair as they relate to human diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Dr. Sweasy’s research team recently discovered that dynamic conformational changes are important for accurate DNA synthesis. The team has also shown that human germline and somatic genetic variants of base excision repair genes are linked to carcinogenesis because they are unable to properly remove damaged DNA bases, leading to genomic instability, mitotic catastrophe, and other cancer-associated phenotypes.","Dr. Sweasy is an internationally recognized expert the genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry of DNA repair.

jmerchant,"Sonic Hedgehog and Gastric Cancer. Studies from my lab focus on the role of bacterial colonization and the development of type B chronic atrophic gastritis in a mouse model. Chronic atrophic gastritis is a precursor lesion in the development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer. We found that the gastrin-deficient mice, which are hypochlorhydric, develop antral gastric tumors within 9 –12 months of age. The tumors appear to be dependent on the microflora. Gastric atrophy exemplified by loss of the acid-secreting parietal cell precedes tumor development as observed in human subjects. We found that Helicobacter infection coincides with acute secretion of Shh from the parietal cells then eventually reduced Shh expression prior to parietal cell atrophy. Apparently pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1b, are sufficient to suppress parietal cell acid secretion and Shh gene expression (Waghray, M et al, Gastroenterology 2010). We showed that gastric acid stimulates Shh gene expression through calcium-mediated PKC activation (El-Zataari, M, Gastroenterology, 2010). During infection by Helicobacter, Gli1+immune cells are recruited to the stomach and over time change their phenotype from pro-inflammatory to immune-suppressive by becoming myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The switch to an immune-suppressive phenotype triggers the epithelium to become metaplastic (El-Zaatari et al., PloS One, 2013; Ding L et al.

The collective behavior of such systems present physicists with some of the most challenging problems in condensed matter, including competing and co-existing spatial broken symmetries, metal-insulator transitions and unconventional superconductivity. The novel materials that we are trying to understand include superconducting organic charge-transfer solids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon superconductors, high temperature oxide superconductors and two-dimensional systems with charge- and spin-frustration. In addition to broken symmetry I am interested in the photophysics of conjugated polymers, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanostructures. Strong Coulomb interactions between electrons and holes in these carbon-based semiconductors give excitons with unusually strong binding energies as the fundamental photoexcitation. The photophysics of these systems are of strong interest both because of the unusual nature of carbon-based semiconductors as well as their potential applications in organic lasers, solar cells and transistors. Much of our theoretical work in this latter area is performed in close collaborations with experimental colleagues with expertise in nonlinear optical spectrscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy.","Theory of quasi-one and two-dimensional strongly correlated-electron systems, from semiconductors to superconductors, from their low temperature behavior to photo

spstock,"Dr. Stock's research is centered on the study of nematodes parasites and pathogens of insects. Her primary focus has been on the so-called “entomopathogenic nematodes” (also known as EPN) which encompass two families, Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae and their bacterial symbionts, γ-Proteobacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, respectively. my research program has branched out to cover various basic and applied aspects of the life history of EPN and their bacterial symbionts. For example, one of her primary research interests relates to the study of the evolutionary relationships among Steinernema spp. and their bacterial symbionts, Xenorhabdus spp., based on the knowledge that the majority of these symbionts species have a specific association with their nematode host. Her lab also investigates aspects that relate to the establishment and maintenance of the mutualistic association between steinernematid nematodes and their bacterial symbionts. Over the past six years her research has provided fundamental knowledge of a structure dedicated to the establishment and maintenance of a symbiotic Furthermore, her team and collaborators are also investigating the physiological and molecular underpinnings of symbiont contributions to nematode fitness. We have been funded by the National Science Foundation to continue with this investigation. Major focus areas of this research are: (a) determine the extent of symbiont specialization among Steinernema nematodes, (b) investigate bacterial traits contributing to nematode fitness and competitiveness and (c) study the molecular basis of symbiont selection during transmission with focus on bacterial genes necessary for colonization. Another area of her research program focuses on the consideration of suitable models for understanding trophic complexities and interactions of mutualists in food webs. Specifically,we consider the EPN-bacterium-insect model system to explore how physiological conditions of one of the three partners – the host insect – affects the system as a whole. Her team is investigating the impact of the insect internal environment (influenced by diet choices) on bacterial symbiont colonization and proliferation, and its effect on its mutualistic partner’s (nematode) fitness. The newest research area in Dr. Stock's program focuses on the study active compounds from symbiotic bacteria of entomopathogenic nematodes, as a bio-rational control strategy of plant parasitic nematodes and plant pathogenic bacteria consideringa multidisciplinary approach encompassing natural product chemistry, molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics. Dr. Stock has authored and co-authored 100 refereed papers, nine chapters in books and edited one book on molecular approaches and techniques for the study of insect pathogens.","Dr. Stock's research is centered on the study of nematodes parasites and pathogens of insects.

I am especially interested in the error-prone nature of molecular (eg transcription, translation, folding) and other developmental processes. Errors in the present can mimic future mutations, and so when selection against the consequences of present errors is strong, this changes the distribution of possible mutations in ways that can have profound consequences.

Herpesviruses are no exception. Our laboratory focusses on the beta-herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus or CMV. CMV latently infects up to 99% of the population worldwide. CMV can reactivate to cause life-threatening disease in leukemia and lymphoma patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. While CMV is not known to cause cancer, oncomodulatory properties have emerged. Our research focuses on understanding how CMV modulates host trafficking and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (e.g., EGFR) and DNA damage repair pathways and the impact of this viral regulation on host cell biology and the maintenance of latency or reactivation from latency.","Viruses cause at least 10-20% of all cancers.

My research involves three levels of investigation. (1) Mathematical foundations of eco-evolutionary modelling: deriving ‘macroscopic’ models of quantitative traits evolution starting from ‘microscopic’ models of individual interactions and heritable variation. (2) Applying the general theory to major questions in ecology and evolution, including the evolution of cooperative interactions at the gene, cell, organism and population levels; life history evolution; evolution of species interactions and community structure and diversity; and eco-evolutionary responses of populations, communities and ecosystems to environmental change. (3) Connecting the theory to specific empirical systems.

lopezg3,"Dr. Lopez’s current research focuses on food safety, water quality and transmission of pathogens in indoor environments. The detection of viruses and bacteria in environmental water samples (lakes and rivers used for recreation, agriculture irrigation systems, potable distribution systems) and fresh produce such as leafy greens is critical to reducing the risk to humans from contact with fresh produce and contaminated water. Through the utilization of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) molecular methods they detect pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses (Norovirus) and bacteria (Salmonella) in order to determine how contaminated various types of environmental waters are. They plan to expand detection methods by using droplet digital (ddPCR) a cutting edge detection platform for detection of pathogens in very small quantities. In addition, understanding the presence and transmission of microbial pathogens in long-term care facilities, outpatient clinics, hospitals, and other indoor environments such as offices and schools is essential in developing better hygenic strategies in reducing the risk of exposure to these dangerous viruses and bacteria. In this area of research, cultural methods are used in conjunction with molecular detection methods specific for each microorganism in order to compare viable but nonculturable organisms.","Dr. Lopez’s current research focuses on food safety, water quality and transmission of pathogens in indoor environments. The detection of viruses and bacteria in environmental water samples (lakes and rivers used for recreation, agriculture irrigation systems, potable distribution systems) and fresh produce such as leafy greens is critical to reducing the risk to humans from contact with fresh produce and contaminated water. Through the utilization of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) molecular methods they detect pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses (Norovirus) and bacteria (Salmonella) in order to determine how contaminated various types of environmental waters are.

As a physician-scientist, Dr. Tardiff’s work focuses on the mechanisms that underlie the development of the most common form of genetic cardiomyopathy, those caused by mutations in proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These complex disorders affect one in 500 individuals of all ages and represent the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the field. Her studies detailing the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis at the level of individual cells using transgenic mouse models has been continuously funded by the NIH since 2001 and the work has been cited in support of new clinical trials to evaluate novel treatment modalities for this challenging cardiomyopathy.  More recently, in collaboration with Steven Schwartz in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona, her lab has developed computational approaches to modeling and eventually predicting disease severity based on protein structure. To fully translate these basic research findings to the clinical realm, one of her main goals remains the development of an HCM Center of Excellence at the University of Arizona where patients from all over the southwest can obtain lifelong cutting edge medical care for this complex and often devastating disorder. Dr. Tardiff was awarded $1.4 million (NIH grant number HL075619) to continue her lab’s study of “Integrative Approach to Divergent Remodeling in Thin Filament Cardiomyopathies.” Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is an often devastating and common cardiac genetic disease.

delamere,"After receiving his doctorate at the University of East Anglia in his native country England, Nicholas Delamere brought his work on membrane transport physiology to the University of Colorado, where he spent ten years. He moved to the University of Louisville in 1986 where he established a laboratory to study the mechanisms which control ocular pressure, fluid movement and the regulation of ion transport molecules in lens and optic nerve. In 2006, together with several lab members, he joined the University of Arizona. In essence, Dr. Delamere examines the manner in which cells transport salt and water. Too much fluid (aqueous humor) secreted into the eye can increase pressure within the eye, leading to glaucoma and retinal damage. Dr. Delamere's research team seeks to regulate these transport mechanisms on the molecular level, with the eventual goal of developing drugs to maintain this intraocular balance and reduce the incidence of glaucoma. In another area of research, Dr. Delamere tackles the problem of age-related cataracts and how they can be affected by regulating the activity of the membrane transport pump Na,K-ATPase. Since human lenses contain the same cells from conception to death, with no tissue regeneration or loss, this area of research offers a promising model for tissue preservation, anti-aging constructs and neuroprotection in the brain. Reducing the onset of cataracts through membrane transport physiology, even for a few more years, would result in huge savings of cost, effort and anxiety.","After receiving his doctorate at the University of East Anglia in his native country England, Nicholas Delamere brought his work on membrane transport physiology to the University of Colorado, where he spent ten years.

Additionally, Dr. Ramirez-Andreotta is the PI of the University of Arizona Superfund Research Program’s Research Translation Core.  She is trained across various fields and is a transdisciplinary researcher in the purest sense. She received a B.A. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, a B.A. degree in Studio Art (Photography), and a Master’s of Public Administration from Columbia University. She received her Ph.D. from the UA in SWES (with a minor in Art) and completed a postdoctoral fellowship with a renowned medical sociologist in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities at Northeastern University. During her postdoctoral work, she gained a deeper understanding of how to collaborate across disciplines and the crucial role the social sciences play in environmental health research and interventions. Her philosophy is that in order to successfully engage communities and students of color, it is essential to address critical environmental health problems identified by the community, and to then work collaboratively through the problem-solving and scientific research process.

The overall goal of Dr. Ramirez-Andreotta’s research program is to build citizen science programs and low-cost environmental monitoring tools to increase public participation in environmental health research. Her objectives are two-fold: 1) developing a fundamental understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment, with a primary focus on plant-soil systems; and 2) designing effective risk communication and data report-back strategies to improve environmental health literacy and education.

wmoore,"My long-term research interest is the evolution of biotic diversity. I use molecular genetic techniques, morphological methods, and robust phylogenetic frameworks to identify and describe natural groups of marine and terrestrial arthropods, to study their diversification and patterns of distribution, and to elucidate the ecological roles and the importance of key innovations that have significantly affected their evolutionary histories. I am especially interested in the evolution of symbiotic lifestyles and investigating how major biotic, climatic, and tectonic events may have influenced the timing and patterns of diversification. Much of my current research is on the carabid beetle subfamily Paussinae, many species of which are obligate symbionts with ants. Other ongoing studies explore the evolution of adephagan beetles and bombardier beetles.

daekyus,"Dr. Daekyu Sun's research activities are directed toward discovering new agents which repress the transcription of oncogenes and oncogenic proteins. His laboratory research projects focus on the two specific areas described below. i) Suppression of mutated RET expression in MTC with small molecules Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) represents the most frequent initial diagnosis for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) patients and is the most common cause of death in these syndromes. The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase for members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of extracellular signaling molecules. Activating germline RET mutations is known to play a central role in the development of MTC. Therefore, the RET protooncogene has been proposed to have a significant place in the prevention and treatment of MTC caused by these syndromes. Their early work has shown that the G-rich and C-rich strands could form specific G-quadruplex or i-motif structures, respectively, on the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the proximal promoter region of the human RET gene. That observation led them to explore a new therapeutic strategy to repress the transcriptional activation of the RET gene with small molecules capable of binding selectively to non-canonical DNA structures formed within the promoter region of this gene. ii) Targeting tumor angiogenesis by targeting the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene The formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, promotes tumor growth by providing oxygen and nutrients to proliferating cancerous cells. The switch to an angiogenic phenotype in cancer cells is often mediated by increased expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a pluripotent cytokinine and angiogenic growth factor and is often transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor HIF-1α under hypoxic condition. In their study, we demonstrated that the conversion of a stable Watson-Crick double helix into an intramolecular G-quadruplex occurs in the polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts found in the proximal promoter of the VEGF gene. They further proved that G-quadruplex-interactive agents induce or even stabilize the secondary structures formed in the same region. They also determined the role of G-quadruplex structures in the VEGF promoter region in the regulation of this gene as transcriptional repressor elements. That observation led them to explore a new therapeutic strategy to repress the transcriptional activation of the human VEGF gene with small molecules capable of binding selectively to non-canonical DNA structures formed within the promoter region of these genes.","Dr. Daekyu Sun's research activities are directed toward discovering new agents which repress the transcription of oncogenes and oncogenic proteins.

Recently, I have shown that gravitational mass of a composite quantum body, mg, is not always equivalent to its total energy and suggested two experiments to detect such events, where the Einstein’s equation, E=mgc2, is broken.

2) Condensed Matter Physics in High Magnetic Fields.
I study exotic superconducting, super-crystalline, spin-density-wave, and unconventional metallic properties of solids in an external magnetic field. Among them, are unconventional superconductivity, including triplet and high temperature singlet d-wave superconductivity, the field-induced spin- and charge-density-waves, the super-crystalline phase in organic conductors and superconductors, the Lebed Magic Angles effects and some other phenomena. In particular, I am interested in investigating of such superconducting phases as the Reentrant superconductivity and the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell phase, which can exist in magnetic fields much higher than both the upper critical magnetic field and the so-called Clogston-Chandrasekhar paramagnetic limit.","I am a theoretical physicist and my scientific interests are subdivided into two major areas.

jam1,"Dr. Martinez’s research has focused on the assessment of the disposition of the bioactive food component limonene, a potential breast cancer chemopreventive found in citrus peel oil. She has developed and published analytical assays to extract limonene and its major metabolite from adipose tissue and biofluids using specific chromatographic methods for quantitation. She has also been involved in early phase clinical trials in the prevention setting for breast cancer using agents such as resveratrol and green tea. Her research focus is moving into the area of metabolomics as a systemic approach to evaluate the effect of chemopreventive agents. Using metabolomics profiling with mass spectrometry-based techniques, she has investigated novel mechanisms and biomarkers of limonene activity after 4 weeks intervention in early stage breast cancer patients (PI: Sherry Chow).

She has also initiated projects in collaboration with Imperial College and Waters Corporation to characterize metabolite profiles in nipple aspirate fluid using multiple analytical platforms (nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). Current research also includes utilizing plasma samples from a phase-III clinical trial (PI: Dr. Patricia Thompson) to characterize changes in oxylipin metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway after administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and relate these changes to colorectal adenoma outcomes.

Future work will focus on applying metabolomics to characterize metabolite signatures in blood and urine pre and post an AI+sulindac intervention in order to understand the determinants of AI-associated pain as well as predicting benefit with sulindac. This work will take place in the context of an R01-funded clinical study of women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors (AI) (PIs Thompson and Stopeck). The study should help guide future research that will identify molecular targets of pain for the ultimate goal of improving AI adherence and reducing death from breast cancer. Future work will also focus on cancer prevention clinical trials in order to identify novel biomarkers of cancer risk or of response to interventions.","Dr. Martinez’s research has focused on the assessment of the disposition of the bioactive food component limonene, a potential breast cancer chemopreventive found in citrus peel oil. She has developed and published analytical assays to extract limonene and its major metabolite from adipose tissue and biofluids using specific chromatographic methods for quantitation. She has also been involved in early phase clinical trials in the prevention setting for breast cancer using agents such as resveratrol and green tea. Her research focus is moving into the area of metabolomics as a systemic approach to evaluate the effect of chemopreventive agents. Using metabolomics profiling with mass spectrometry-based techniques, she has investigated novel mechanisms and biomarkers of limonene activity after 4 weeks intervention in early stage breast cancer patients (PI: Sherry Chow).

She has also initiated projects in collaboration with Imperial College and Waters Corporation to characterize metabolite profiles in nipple aspirate fluid using multiple analytical platforms (nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). Current research also includes utilizing plasma samples from a phase-III clinical trial (PI: Dr. Patricia Thompson) to characterize changes in oxylipin metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway after administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and relate these changes to colorectal adenoma outcomes.

Future work will focus on applying metabolomics to characterize metabolite signatures in blood and urine pre and post an AI+sulindac intervention in order to understand the determinants of AI-associated pain as well as predicting benefit with sulindac.

rlm,"Roger L. Miesfeld, Ph.D., Professor and Co-Chair, Dept. of Chemistry & Biochemistry, College of Science, University of Arizona. Mosquitoes are human disease vectors that transmit pathogens through blood feeding. One of these disease vectors is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which have rapidly expanded their habitat and are contributing annually to 500,000 cases of Dengue hemorrhagic fever. On an even greater scale, Anopheline mosquitoes account for 250 million cases of malaria/yr, with up to 1 million deaths annually. The most common adult insecticides used for mosquito control are pyrethroids, which inhibit evolutionarily conserved sodium channels in the mosquito nervous system. Although these compounds have proven to be effective, mosquito resistance is an increasing problem and there is a pressing need to develop the next generation of safe and effective agents. Since blood meal feeding creates a unique metabolic challenge as a result of the extremely high protein and iron content of blood, it is possible that interfering with blood meal metabolism could provide a novel control strategy for mosquito born diseases. Our long term goal is to identify small molecule inhibitors that block blood meal metabolism in vector mosquitoes, resulting in feeding-induced death of the adult female, or a significant reduction in egg viability, as a strategy to control vector mosquito populations in areas of high disease transmission.","Roger L.

The first area is centered on identifying and characterizing existing genomic variation in plant populations to better understand the dynamics of phenotypic diversity. The second area concentrates on using emerging high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) technologies to quantify and record complex phenotypes that are responsive to environmental fluctuations throughout the plant’s life cycle in order to understand temporal trait expression patterns. The final area is focused on discovering allelic variants and causative genes responsible for observed phenotypic variation through the use of genetic mapping populations and statistical methods. Together, my research program’s findings are used to more efficiently develop improved crop cultivars that are capable of meeting the socioeconomic demands and environmental constraints of the future.

clsmith1,"Smith's research is focused on epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression, particularly their regulation through signaling pathways and their modulation by anti-cancer drugs. Epigenetic mechanisms play a very important role in transcriptional regulation of genes but the specifics of these mechanisms require ongoing study. Many studies focus on the role of post-translational modification of histone proteins, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Smith's view is that this is only part of the full picture.  Non-histone proteins that associate with chromatin can also be post-translationally modified.  Without knowledge of how modified histones and non-histone proteins work together to achieve regulation of gene expression, we will not have a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Currently, we are focused on acetylation of transcriptional regulatory proteins.  Proteomic studies have identified almost 2000 non-histone proteins that are modified by acetylation in different cellular compartments yet only a small fraction of these proteins have been studied to determine how the acetylation impacts their function. We currently have two active projects that focus on the role of acetylation in signaling to chromatin.

Steroid receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that serve to regulate many important physiological processes.  Glucocorticoids regulate metabolism, immune function, stress and anxiety responses, and are important for lung development.  They bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and activate it to bind to specific DNA sequences in target genes.  The GR is known to associate with lysine acetyltransferases, which acetylate proteins and help the GR regulate transcription.  Our work has also revealed an important role for lysine deacetylases (KDACs) in the activation of transcription by GR.  This is surprising since KDACs are often cast as repressive to transcription because they remove histone acetylation.  Our current goals for this project are to understand how KDACs cooperate with GR in the activation of target genes, identify which KDACs are involved (there are 11 possible candidates), and determine which proteins they deacetylate to facilitate transcription at GR target genes. 

The second project is focused on the role of KDACs in growth and survival signaling in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).  Over the last 20 years, drugs which target KDACs have been developed, resulting in recent FDA approvals for the treatment of a rare form of NHL, cutaneous T cell lymphoma.  We have chosen to focus our efforts on the most common form of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  This is an aggressive lymphoma that must be treated.  The current treatment strategy is highly efficient initially, but about 50% of patients relapse within 5 years.  Thus, new drugs like KDAC inhibitors are needed to either prolong remission or effectively treat relapsed DLBCL.  Our goal is to understand how KDAC-inhibiting drugs impact growth in survival signaling in this cancer.  Through these studies, we have developed cell-based models of sensitivity and resistance to these drugs in DLBCL.  We are focused on understanding the mechanisms behind sensitivity and resistance in an effort to identify biomarkers that predict response to these drugs and to find other therapeutics that might synergize with KDAC inhibitors to kill resistant DLBCL cells.

The red queen hypothesis states that the host-parasite arms race results in an uneasy balance. Many persistent viruses have co-evolved along-side their hosts for millions of years. Under normal conditions, most persistent viruses do not cause overt disease in the host. Papillomaviruses have evolved to usurp the cellular machinery to complete their life-cycle. The papillomaviral lifecycle perturbs the normal differentiation cycle of the infected cell, forcing cells to divide far beyond their natural lifespan. It is feasible that the continued insult provided by replicating viruses eventually results in malignant transformation of the infected cell. However, while the persistent infection is key to viral oncogenesis, many long-term persisting viruses do not cause cancer. We use cutting-edge technologies and approaches to elucidate which viral phenotypes are associated with oncogenic progression.

lnagy,"I am interested in exploring the genetic basis of morphological diversity. To do this, I ask how developmental regulatory networks known to pattern a particular aspect of morphology in one organism are modified in other related organisms. At the moment, the focus of the lab is on the evolution of arthropod body plans and appendages and axial patterning in molluscs and other lophotrochozoan phyla. Arthropods show a large degree of variation in segmental and limb patterning. Segments, or groups of segments, have repeatedly become specialized for feeding, walking or swimming. Many of the key genes and genetic pathways that regulate segmentation and limb formation have been worked out through molecular genetic analyses in Drosophila or other model organisms.  We ask what role developmental regulatory genes play in the evolution of morphological diversity and whether there are properties of developmental systems that constrain or promote phylogenetic change. Other areas of interest include the molecular evolution of the HOX clusters, modeling developmental pathways, the developmental mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of life history strategies.","I am interested in exploring the genetic basis of morphological diversity.

zeidersk,"Katharine Zeiders received her BS, MS & Ph.D. in Family and Human Development from Arizona State University and completed additional post-doctoral training at Northwestern University. In 2014, Dr. Zeiders accepted her first academic position at the University of Missouri but was fortunate enough to return to her home state of Arizona in 2016 to accept an Assistant Professor position at the University of Arizona.

Since that time, Dr. Zeiders’ academic career has flourished – she has published over 53 peer-reviewed articles, served as an Editorial Board member for three top-tier developmental journals, and most recently, received funding for her research from the National Science Foundation.

As an Assistant Professor, Dr. Zeiders has consistently taught two undergraduate classes and tackled important research topics with “real world” implications.  Katharine has developed innovative approaches for studying the effects of stress process on Latino youth. Her research focus is on Latino families and youth’s wellbeing. Just this year, Dr. Zeiders was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. Her work operates from a general stress process model and draws from the risk and resilience literature to (a) identify relevant challenges related to Latino families and youth’ wellbeing (b) explore biological processes mediating the link between challenges and well-being and (c) identify the ways in which individuals and family cultural orientations, beliefs and behaviors moderate stress processes. Although these accomplishments are noteworthy, what Katharine is most proud of is her Arizona roots and her ability to inspire and mentor students like herself as they pursue their academic goals.

Dr Zeiders was born in Willcox, Arizona and spent her childhood working on the family farm. It was these experiences - working every day alongside her parents and six siblings to maintain the family business - which she believes laid the foundation for her to thrive in academic contexts. Plus, it was countless teachers at every academic turn that reminded Katharine of her abilities to succeed and propelled her to where she is now. She continues to be inspired and motivated by youth from various backgrounds who persist in academic settings and impact their communities.","Katharine Zeiders received her BS, MS & Ph.D. in Family and Human Development from Arizona State University and completed additional post-doctoral training at Northwestern University.

Dean Miller taught at Emory University Law School from 1988-2005, where he served as Associate Dean for Faculty and Scholarship (2003-2005). He is a graduate of the University of Chicago Law School and Pomona College, and grew up in Los Angeles.

Dean Miller writes and teaches about environmental law and policy and criminal law and policy. He is the author of more than 70 articles and essays on a wide range of environmental, criminal justice, immigration and legal theory topics. He is editor of several casebooks on criminal procedure and sentencing, and co-founded the Federal Sentencing Reporter, the leading journal on sentencing law and policy and a joint project of the Vera Institute of Justice and the University of California Press. He currently serves as a series editor for Summits - books focused on the intersection of environmental science, law, and policy.

Dean Miller's scholarship addresses the nature of law. On the criminal side, current work includes a series of articles on the role and regulation of prosecutorial discretion, including a multi-year empirical evaluation of prosecutorial decision-making. At a more general theoretical level, this work deals with policymaking within executive branch agencies, especially in those areas not readily amenable to external judicial or legislative review. His environmental work highlights topics at the intersection of environmental science, policy, and law with special attention to the concept of sustainability and to the relationship between science and environmental policy-making. Much of his environmental work is done in collaboration with natural and social scientists.

At Arizona, Dean Miller serves as co-director of the Arizona Law Program in Criminal Law and Policy, and has joint and affiliated appointments with the University of Arizona Institute of the Environment, the Environmental Health Sciences Program of the University of Arizona Zuckerman School of Public Health, and with the Global Change PhD minor, among other programs and institutes. He serves on various university committees, including a workgroup through the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship at the Eller College of Management to create a new Masters program focusing on capitalizing ventures. He also serves on the steering committee developing a new graduate degree certificate program in American Indian natural resource, and as Associate Director for Interdisciplinary Education for the Arizona Telemedicine Program.

Before teaching, Dean Miller served as law clerk to Chief Judge John Godbold of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, as Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice, and as Special Counsel at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York. Dean Miller has been a visiting professor at Stanford Law School and Duke Law School. Dean Miller is a member of the American Law Institute (ALI), and an advisor to various criminal justice and environmental publications and organizations.","Marc L. Miller is the Dean & Ralph W. Bilby Professor of Law at the University of Arizona College of Law. Dean Miller taught at Emory University Law School from 1988-2005, where he served as Associate Dean for Faculty and Scholarship (2003-2005). He is a graduate of the University of Chicago Law School and Pomona College, and grew up in Los Angeles.

Dean Miller writes and teaches about environmental law and policy and criminal law and policy. He is the author of more than 70 articles and essays on a wide range of environmental, criminal justice, immigration and legal theory topics. He is editor of several casebooks on criminal procedure and sentencing, and co-founded the Federal Sentencing Reporter, the leading journal on sentencing law and policy and a joint project of the Vera Institute of Justice and the University of California Press. He currently serves as a series editor for Summits - books focused on the intersection of environmental science, law, and policy.

Dean Miller's scholarship addresses the nature of law. On the criminal side, current work includes a series of articles on the role and regulation of prosecutorial discretion, including a multi-year empirical evaluation of prosecutorial decision-making. At a more general theoretical level, this work deals with policymaking within executive branch agencies, especially in those areas not readily amenable to external judicial or legislative review. His environmental work highlights topics at the intersection of environmental science, policy, and law with special attention to the concept of sustainability and to the relationship between science and environmental policy-making. Much of his environmental work is done in collaboration with natural and social scientists.

At Arizona, Dean Miller serves as co-director of the Arizona Law Program in Criminal Law and Policy, and has joint and affiliated appointments with the University of Arizona Institute of the Environment, the Environmental Health Sciences Program of the University of Arizona Zuckerman School of Public Health, and with the Global Change PhD minor, among other programs and institutes. He serves on various university committees, including a workgroup through the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship at the Eller College of Management to create a new Masters program focusing on capitalizing ventures. He also serves on the steering committee developing a new graduate degree certificate program in American Indian natural resource, and as Associate Director for Interdisciplinary Education for the Arizona Telemedicine Program.

Of the conditions my lab is currently studying, we are particularly interested in how chronic and quick, sequenced light exposure can be designed to: 1. promote normal healthy aging and 2. strengthen adaptive cognitive/emotional responses to being awake in the middle of the night (12-6AM), a key interval of the 24-h cycle that we have associated with increased suicidal ideation and mortality. Our circadian work on suicide is done in very close partnership with the University of Arizona Sleep Health and Research Program directed by Dr. Michael Grandner.",,,,,,,,,,

I work closely with optical scientists, biomedical engineers, chemists and molecular biologists to develop novel methods of detecting cancer and other diseases before they can be seen by the naked eye. We are developing unique instruments that see in multiple directions at the same time as well as optical techniques that instantly reveal structural and functional changes in disease states that are invisible to the human eye. These methods will help detect disorders at an earlier and easily treatable stage, in real-time and at the point of care, without the use of dyes, stains or other chemicals (label-free imaging).”","""My research interest is in bringing novel optical and engineering solutions to gastrointestinal disorders.

My approach is comparative and interdisciplinary in research, teaching, and outreach.  Since the mid 1980s I have focused on issues of water markets, privatization, conflicts, and governance;  hydroelectric power, multiple water uses, and river basin development;  and the law and political economy of regulation and property rights.  In recent years I have turned to the nexus between water and electricity policies, particularly as they affect hydropower, in the current context of climate and environmental change.  My regional expertise is in the Western United States and Latin America, especially Chile where I have lived and worked for many years.  I work with graduate students and colleagues, both U.S. and foreign, to study water policies in the Americas as well as Spain, the European Union, Australia, and the international arena in general.  I am concerned with empirical issues of law and public policy and I aim to bridge the gap between academic and policy audiences. I am regularly interviewed about water policy by journalists, professionals, and students in Latin America, the U.S.A., and Europe.

My overall goal is to combine legal studies with environmental studies:  to integrate different fields of law, history, geography, politics, and economics as they relate to water, land, and nature.  This interdisciplinary approach to human-environment relations, grounded in history and the physical world, is what geography means to me.  I have concentrated on water resources both because they are important in themselves and because water circulates through and ties together all other natural resources and environmental systems, making water a unique window on the world.  More generally (beyond water), I am interested in the relationship between market economics, legal and institutional arrangements, and environment, and I focus my analytical framework on property rights because that is the area where all these fields overlap most closely.  In recent years I have worked to strengthen the connections between the fields of geography and law-&-society, two interdisciplinary traditions with surprisingly little interaction.","I work on problems of water rights and water policy at the intersection of law, geography, and political economy.

bpanders,"Anderson's research involves the study of quantum fluid dynamics and quantum turbulence in dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates, or BECs. These tiny droplets of superfluid are the coldest known objects in the universe and are created using laser cooling and atom trapping techniques. They also provide a unique and versatile medium for the experiments of quantum fluid dynamics in Anderson’s lab at the College of Optical Sciences. In a superfluid such as a BEC, microscopic centers of fluid circulation called quantized vortices may be observed using optical techniques and are conspicuous indicators of the system’s superfluid dynamics. By studying the way vortices are generated and how they move and interact, a wide range of general physical phenomena well beyond Bose-Einstein condensation may be better understood. Examples include phase transition dynamics, turbulence, reduced-dimensional quantum physics and the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium.

Anderson was a member of the research team that first created and observed quantized vortices in BECs in 1999, and since then has been primarily involved in experimental, numerical and theoretical studies of vortex creation, manipulation and dynamics in BECs. Current efforts in his laboratory focus on:

developing new methods for vortex generation and manipulation with laser beams for controlled studies of vortex dynamics,
studying the dynamics and statistics of vortices of two-dimensional quantum turbulence and
development of new methods for studying and observing vortices in BECs.","Anderson's research involves the study of quantum fluid dynamics and quantum turbulence in dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates, or BECs.

In a superfluid such as a BEC, microscopic centers of fluid circulation called quantized vortices may be observed using optical techniques and are conspicuous indicators of the system’s superfluid dynamics. By studying the way vortices are generated and how they move and interact, a wide range of general physical phenomena well beyond Bose-Einstein condensation may be better understood. Examples include phase transition dynamics, turbulence, reduced-dimensional quantum physics and the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium.

Anderson was a member of the research team that first created and observed quantized vortices in BECs in 1999, and since then has been primarily involved in experimental, numerical and theoretical studies of vortex creation, manipulation and dynamics in BECs. Current efforts in his laboratory focus on:

developing new methods for vortex generation and manipulation with laser beams for controlled studies of vortex dynamics,
studying the dynamics and statistics of vortices of two-dimensional quantum turbulence and
development of new methods for studying and observing vortices in BECs.",,,,,,,,,,

Topics have included the causes and consequences of personal bankruptcy and mortgage foreclosures; the role of credit bureau data, credit scoring and risk management tools in expanding access to consumer loans in the U.S. and globally; and the pros and cons of improved loan disclosures and regulatory limits on loan products in helping consumers to make good credit choices.

I’ve also conducted projects for the National Retail Federation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other national associations on issues such as credit card usage patterns and the impact of privacy and data usage regulations on the products and customer service offered by retail financial services firms.

I’m particularly proud of a series of projects sponsored by American Express and the Consumer Federation of America that demonstrate the rehabilitative effects of credit counseling on long-term borrower behavior.  I am also proud of our efforts to create pilot demonstration projects here at the University of Arizona that pair financial education with financial products (e.g., savings programs; student loans) to encourage and support completion of higher education degrees. 

Over the past decade, when director of the Take Charge America Institute here at the UA, I gained extensive experience in developing and scaling up financial education programs for youth in classroom and online environments, as well as through peer-to-peer programs.

Recently, the theme of her research has turned to the role of symbiotic microorganisms on the ecology and evolution of natural enemies. Dr. Hunter has found a bacterial symbiont in the Bacteroidetes, recently named Cardinium hertigii, that is unrelated to the better known proteobacterium, Wolbachia, but also manipulates the reproduction of is hosts in ways that enhances its transmission. Like Wolbachia, it induces parthenogenesis as well as cytoplasmic incompatibility in the autoparasitoid genus Encarsia, two reproductive phenotypes thought to be unique to Wolbachia.","Martha Hunter, PhD, conducts research largely focused on understanding the evolutionary biology and ecology of parasitoids and predators important in biological control of agricultural pests.

rpalaniv,"Ravishankar Palanivelu, PhD, possesses a long-term goal to understand the molecular basis of how cells communicate with each other. His lab employs pollen tube guidance during Arabidopsis thaliana reproduction as a model system to achieve this goal. Currently, the focus remains to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie pollen tube functions in A. thaliana.A pollen tube's journey to an egg cell within the pistil involves a series of cell-cell interactions such as attraction, repulsion and adhesion (Illustration 1, mov file). While these processes are likely mediated by several guidance signals, only a handful of guidance signals produced by female tissues have been identified. The guidance of pollen tubes into the ovule micropyle is highly reproducible, resembling the polarized migration of axons, yet sharing few genes in common. Dr. Palanivelu’s lab is undertaking a multidisciplinary approach - Genetics, Cell Biology and Biochemistry - to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie pollen tube functions in A. thaliana. Characterization of pollen tube guidance in A. thaliana holds enormous potential as it focuses on a process that is: 1) very unique to plants, 2) poorly understood at the molecular level, 3) amenable to genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques, and 4) a rapid way to identify novel plant signals that allow communication between cells possible despite their thick extracellular walls. Additionally, we have recently developed an in vitro pollen tube guidance assay in A. thaliana that monitors both attractive and repulsive interactions between pollen tubes and ovules, processes normally difficult to discern by virtue of them occurring within opaque pistils. These attributes therefore make pollen tube guidance in A. thaliana an ideal model system to study cell-cell interaction in plants.","Ravishankar Palanivelu, PhD, possesses a long-term goal to understand the molecular basis of how cells communicate with each other.

jkota,"Dr. Kota's research interest is centered around energetic particles, solar wind, and magnetic fields in the Heliosphere. He conducts theoretical and numerical studies on galactic and anomalous cosmic rays, as well as fast neutral atoms, which offer a unique tool to probe the remote areas of the heliosphere. He has developed a number of numerical codes to model the transport and acceleration of cosmic rays in the interplanetary magnetic field.

Recently, he has been involved in modeling space weather in the Earth's environment. The aim of this research is to understand, model, and forecast large solar energetic particle (SEP) events; to understand the mechanism how Coronal Mass Ejections drive a shock and accelerate ions to high (often relativistic) energies.","Dr. Kota's research interest is centered around energetic particles, solar wind, and magnetic fields in the Heliosphere.

shahidua,"In the anterior part of our eye there are two cavities filled with a watery but nutritive fluid called aqueous humor. One cavity, called the anterior chamber, lies just behind the cornea and in front of the iris. The other, called the posterior chamber, is a narrow space behind the iris and is surrounded by a mucsuloepithelial structure called the ciliary body. Aqueous humor is contiuously formed into the posterior chamber by the double layer ciliary epithelium that covers the ciliary body. Aqueous humor then sips through the hole at the center of iris, called the pupil, into the anterior chamber. Excess aqueous humor leaves the anterior chamber, by a pressure dependent way, mainly through a sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork located at the junction of the cornea and the sclera. Apart from supplying the nutrients and removing metabolic wastes from the avascular tissues of the eye, namely, the cornea, trabecular meshwork and the lens, the aqueous humor maintains the optimum intraocular pressure of~15 mmHg that are extremely important to maintain perfect geometry of the ocular structures necessary for optimum light transmission and good vision. An imbalance between the production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium and its outflow through the trabecular meshwork can cause abnormally high intraocular pressure (above 20 mmHg), a painful condition called glaucoma. Abnormal high ocular pressure, if not treated, affect the posterior segment of the eye, particularly it causes the death or degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, the cells that constitute our optic nerve and that are responsible to carry light signals from the photoreceptors to the brain to produce vision. If there is no healthy ganglion cell, there is no vision. Thus glaucoma is a blinding disease and it is the second most important eye disease responsible for vision loss throughout the world. Currently there is no cure to glaucoma and keeping the intraocular pressure under control is the only available and successful treatment to rescue the ganglion cells and to delay or stop vision loss. Intraocular pressure can be kept under control by either reducing the production of aqueous humoror by increasing its outflow. My research in the anterior segment of the eye is directed towards reducing the secretion/production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium. To be able to reduce secretion, we must understand how this fluid is secreted by the ciliary epithelium. Currently the mechanisms and the molecular entities, i.e, the transporter proteins, channels and enzymes associated with the ciliary epithelium and that are responsible for shifting solutes and water from the blood to the posterior chamber in order to produce aqueous humor are not fully understood. Our laboratory is dedicated: (1)  in identifying the transport molecules and enzymes required for aqueous humor secretion, (2)  in characterizing these molecules functionally and (3) in identifying and characterizing the signal transduction mechanisms that regulate the functions of these molecules and (4) in pharmacological regulation of these molecules and /or the associated signal transduction mechanisms. My research in the posterior segment of the eye is directed toward finding the cause and understanding the mechanism of death of the ganglion cells in the retina. In glaucoma one of the initial phenotypic events in the death of ganglion cells appears to be the degeneration of the axons that collectively form the optic nerve. The axons of all the ganglion cells of the retina form a bundle at the exit point through the sclera, called the optic nerve head Retina is a complex nervous tissue and has many different cell types including the two most important supportive cells, the microglial cells and the astrocytes. Microglia and in particular the astrocytes have been associated with various aspects of glaucoma. These include biochemical and structural changes in the optic nerve head, biochemical changes in the extracellular matrix surrounding the optic nerve head, vascular pathology, and direct modulation of retinal ganglion cell survival. Our laboratory is dedicated: (1) in finding the biochemical and functional changes that occur in optic nerve head astrocytes in primary culture when subjected to high pressure, (2) in finding the biochemical changes that occur in the extracellular matrix, by analyzing the culture medium of astrocytes subjected to high pressure and (3) in identifying and characterizing the signal transduction mechanisms that underlie and regulate the above (1, 2) biochemical and functional changes. Experimental model systems and methodology we use We use novel, innovative and viable experimental model systems and up to date methodologies. Our laboratory is equipped with the state of the art facilities that are commensurate with cutting edge technology. Some of the experimental model systems we use are unique to this laboratory. For example, (1) the in vitro whole eye preparation to study physiology and pharmacology of aqueous humor dynamics, ocular vasculature, and ocular drug delivery, (2) primary culture of ocular nonpigmented cilliary epithelium to study ion transport mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level.","In the anterior part of our eye there are two cavities filled with a watery but nutritive fluid called aqueous humor.

Dr. Carter is also the Director of the Center for Digital Humanities for the College of Humanities.

Most recently, Dr. Carter was the Keynote Speaker at the International Conference on Language, Linguistics and Literature (L3) in Singapore and has been invited again as a Visiting Professor at the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne.

""Recognizing that the Digital Humanities are of ever-increasing importance in the development of any culture, the question now becomes, how to nurture, develop and encourage COH faculty to naturally incorporate Digital Humanities into nearly all that we do as Humanists. Through this Center, we will explore the most effective ways to accomplish this task”.

He has published numerous articles on his doctoral project, Virtual Harlem and has presented it at locations around the world. His research focuses on advanced visualization and how sustained and varied digital communication affects student retention and engagement in literature courses taught both online and face-to-face.

Dr. Carter's experience with virtual environments began with his dissertation project on which he began work in 1997; a representation of a portion of Harlem, NY as it existed during the 1920s Jazz Age and Harlem Renaissance. This project, Virtual Harlem, was one of the earliest full virtual reality environments created for use in the humanities and certainly one of the first for use in an African American literature course. Virtual Harlem has been presented at venues in Paris, The Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, and multiple sites in the US.  In 2004, the University of Paris IV- Sorbonne, funded the development of Virtual Montmartre. Dr. Carter was asked to be the project leader and was awarded the prestigious ""Professeur Invite"" from the Sorbonne to spend 6 months in Paris.  This project realized itself in the development of an interactive Web Site and a small 3D representation of the Lapin Agile, the oldest surviving cabaret in Montmartre which is still in operation. The evolution of Virtual Harlem was funded in 2006 by the National Black Programming Consortium and the Government of Norway with the development of Virtual Harlem and Virtual Montmartre in Second Life. These sites were two of the most important locations during the Jazz Age/Harlem Renaissance. Dr. Carter began teaching classes that met totally in Second Life in 2005 where his students have participated in role play, developed content and have collaborated with students from around the world.

In addition to these activities, Dr. Carter is very active with faculty development nationally and internationally. He has conducted workshops for faculty on Digital Humanities as well as specialized topics such as ""Generational Learning Styles"", ""Podcasting"", ""Blogging"", ""Internet Broadcasting"" and Second Life. He has done summer workshops for the National Council for Teachers of English on Digital Humanities, led a workshop session for the Digital Africana Studies Conference at the University of Maryland-College Park, conducted  workshops on Technology in the Classroom at Alabama A&M, and at international venues such as Vaxjo University in Sweden and the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne. Dr. Carter is regularly invited to venues around the world to offer keynote addresses or to serve on panels on Digital Humanities.

We have developed systems in budding yeast that allow us to readily identify chromosome changes and study how they were formed. We do a lot of genetics, introducing genetic mutations in specific checkpoint and DNA replication proteins and then measuring chromosome change. Our studies have encompassed the areas of replication fork biology, DNA repair and genome structure.

Genome Instability in Yeast: Getting at the Mechanisms of Genetic Change

In my 20 years here at the University of Arizona, I now find myself in a fascinating as well as mysterious field of study, that of genome instability. Chromosomes, the source of information that dictates a cells behavior, are complex and fascinating structures. As we now know, information in chromosomes directs the synthesis of RNA and protein molecules that more directly affect cell behavior. Changes to chromosomes changes that protein and RNA-encoded information, and thus changes a cells behavior. Chromosome changes are key to both how organisms evolve (long time scale) and how pathology arises (short time scale). As a graduate student some 30 years ago, I first embarked on the study of chromosome change in bacteria (ref1). As a postdoc I discovered a key control called checkpoints that coordinates DNA repair and the cell cycle, and normally prevents chromosome changes (ref 2,3,4,5,6). My laboratory now is devoted to the study of chromosome change in eukaryotic cells.

To study chromosome change, we currently use the model organism S. cerevisiae, called budding yeast. We plan to extend our studies to other cell types as principles of instability become clear. Chromosome changes in all organisms are often associated with errors committed by the replication fork, a complex structure that duplicates DNA each cell division (Figure 1). When this machin, and/or associated other molecular machines, makes an error, large-scale chromosome changes arise wherein two chromosome segments are joined that were not previously adjacent (Figure 2). Large-scale changes are now known to be prevalent in many cancer cells (ref7). An early and famous example is the translocation called the Philadelphia Chromosome, resulting in altered gene function and leukemia.

We have developed systems in budding yeast that allow us to readily identify chromosome changes and study how they were formed. We do a lot of genetics, introducing genetic mutations in specific checkpoint and DNA replication proteins and then measuring chromosome change. Our studies have encompassed the areas of replication fork biology, DNA repair and genome structure. There is considerable literature in all three, and it takes considerable intellectual effort to make sense of how each contributes to genome instability.

Recently we have made two major findings that we continue to pursue. (9-12). First, we found that dicentrics, that is, chromosomes with 2 centromeres, play a major role in large-scale changes. Dicentrics have long been known to be associated with chromosome changes (ref13), yet how they are normally prevented, and how they form when prevention fails, is unknown and a very active area of research. Second, we are assimilating what is known about replication fork proteins with our studies of the roles of these proteins in preventing chromosome changes. We formulate and test specific models of how specific proteins normally prevent instability. We summarze our study of > 50 protein, acting in a dozen different protein complexes and systems, into a heat map that reveals the relative contributions of replication fork systems to genome stability (Fig3). We continue to develop and test the connections between replication fork systems and genome instability (14 review).","I study genome instability in yeast and getting at the mechanisms of genetic change.

The plant life cycle alternates between a diploid sporophyte generation and a haploid gametophyte generation. The angiosperm female gametophyte is critical to the reproductive process. It is the structure within which egg cell production and fertilization take place. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, Dr. Yadegari and his lab are focusing on two specific processes: 1) development of the female gametophyte and 2) control of seed initiation by gene-regulatory complexes before and after fertilization. For example, they use a combination of expression-based analyses and genetic resources of Arabidopsis to identify major gene-regulatory networks involved in differentiation of the female gametophyte cell types. Similarly, using biochemical, molecular and genetic approaches, they identify components of the Polycomb-group complexes that mediate epigenetic repression of gene expression before fertilization.","Ramin Yadegari, PhD, is interested in understanding the gene-regulatory processes that mediate fertilization and initiation of seed development.

jxb,"Judith Becerra is a Chemical ecologist at the Department of Biosphere 2, University of Arizona, where she does research on insect evolution, insect-plant and insect-bacteria interactions. As an undergraduate student at the National University of Mexico she focused in field ecology. Later she moved to the U. S. and did a PD at the University of Arizona on the ecology and evolution of insect-plant interactions. During her graduate studies she received awards from the Organization of American States (1985), the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (1986), the National Audubon Society (1991) and the Center for Insect Science at the University of Arizona (1991).  Then she became interested in chemistry and molecular biology and their applications in ecology.  With funding from a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellowship in Molecular Evolutionary Studies (1993-1995) and two postdoctoral fellowships from the National Science Foundation (1995-1997) she learned DNA sequencing and phylogenetic reconstruction as well as analytical chemistry. With her last postdoctoral award from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (2001-2202) she studied time calibration of phylogenies using fossil data and techniques to reconstruct chemical characters using phylogenies.  In 2002 she started a faculty position at the Department of Entomology of the University of Arizona and then in 2007 she moved to the Department of Biosphere 2 where she was awarded continuing status in 2009.

            One of the most fascinating and challenging questions in biology is why biodiversity is higher in some groups than others. It is well known that interactions between species can drive evolutionary processes that promote species diversification. Judith Becerra’s research examines how chemical communication among species has contributed to the generation of the diversity of life. In her current studies she combine analytical chemistry with molecular phylogenetics, ecology, and biogeography to understand how chemical compounds in plants have promoted insect diversity on Earth. To perform this research I received the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (2003), a Beckman Young Investigator award from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation (2005), and was named Kavli Fellow by theU. S. National Academy of Sciences in 2009.  She also studies the impact of bacterial symbiosis in formation of defensive chemicals in heteropterans. She is the author of 49 scientific articles, including one in Science and six in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. She is a member of the National Researchers System (SNI 2) of the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT). She is regularly invited to give seminars and presentations in national and international institutions and meetings and her research is cited in leading textbooks on evolution and plant-insect interactions.

dba,"Archangeli’s research explores both the fundamental concepts of how phonological systems are organized and the concrete ways in which sounds are used and produced in language.

Her conceptual research, Emergent Phonology (or Minimalist Phonology), asks the question of how much does phonological acquisition rely on innate, language-specific capabilities, and how much can rely on the human’s ability to extract similarities and generalizations from even very small amounts of input data. Diminishing the role of “Universal Grammar” for phonology leads to a different conception of lexical representations and the relations among them. A consequence is the elimination of vexing phonological issues such as abstract underlying representations and opaque surface patterns. (Much of this work is done in collaboration with Douglas Pulleyblank, University of British Columbia.)

This work is a continuation of her earlier work on underspecified representations, which focused on determining the minimal amount of information necessary and sufficient for expressing phonological patterns.

Archangeli also carries out basic research in the field, both documentation and experimental work, in Scotland, Assam (India), and Lombok (Indonesia), as well as looking at English in the United States. These efforts focus on determining the articulation of specific sounds in local languages through the use of ultrasound, and documenting sound systems of lesser studied languages.

kcooper,"Global food safety is a critical One Health issue, as the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally there are an estimated 600 million foodborne infections every year, resulting in 420,000 deaths from eating contaminated food. In the U.S. there are an estimated 48 million cases of foodborne illness per year (i.e., one out of every six people are sickened). Many foodborne pathogens can cause years of chronic health complications or sequelae after acute infection (e.g. reactive arthritis, kidney problems, neurological disorders, and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS)). In children, chronic diarrhea caused by these pathogens is associated with growth stunting, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Foodborne diseases cost the global economy billions of dollars in added healthcare costs and lost work production. In the U.S. over half of these infections are linked to the produce industry, as fresh produce tends to be consumed raw, which eliminates the critical pathogen control step of cooking. To decrease the global burden of foodborne illness we need critical improvements in food safety; however, constant changes in the food industry and an increase in globalization of food supply are serious challenges to food safety. The ultimate goal of my research program is to improve food safety for U.S. consumers, food security around the world, and ultimately improve global health. Broadly, the Cooper laboratory’s research focuses on the genomics, pathogenesis and epidemiology of various bacterial foodborne pathogens to help improve global food safety Specifically, the Cooper laboratory’s research is focused on using cutting edge molecular and bioinformatic methods to address current and future food safety challenges. In particular, my research provides the food industry with cost effective, applicable, and rapid solutions to numerous public health challenges, but also supports public health agencies, policy makers, and the general population. My research program centers around three key themes: (1) Investigating and exploiting the role that agricultural microbiomes have in food safety; (2) Improving detection of food contaminated by pathogens, clinical diagnostics, and outbreak source tracking using highly accurate whole genome sequencing (WGS) methods; (3) Identifying novel virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis and post-infectious complications (sequelae) of Campylobacter. To address these themes my research has a multi-disciplinary approach to the connection between people, animals, plants and the environment (One Health), which allows me to address food safety issues by collaborating with veterinarians, plant biologists, bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, medical doctors, extension specialists, science communicators, microbiologists, and various members of the food industry.","Global food safety is a critical One Health issue, as the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally there are an estimated 600 million foodborne infections every year, resulting in 420,000 deaths from eating contaminated food.

mbolger,"Building on my earlier studies of mechanistic reasoning, my current research is investigating development of reasoning about more complex biological mechanisms. My work focuses primarily on two populations – biology graduate students and undergraduates in upper division biology courses. Like their faculty mentors, graduate students are involved in the process of building and refining models. However, little is known about how these students learn to use model-based reasoning. Thus I am focused on defining the intermediate reasoning states between novice and expert researchers. Additionally, I am interested in exposing students to authentic biological reasoning at points earlier than graduate school.  She is collaborating to develop a model for bringing the reasoning practices of biologists into an upper division undergraduate course. Research within this course will include describing the forms of reasoning that students reveal during small group problem solving sessions.

Modern biologists employ a set of practices and reasoning skills that allow them to construct models of natural phenomena and refine these models through experimentation and hypothesis testing. Expert models of the phenomena they research are typically dynamic, detailed and full of causal connections. Model building is heavily connected to the physical and mental work biologists do in the laboratory. The formal and informal models that biologists use are highly productive tools for explaining and making predictions about the biological world. My interest is in understanding the development of these forms of reasoning and practice. 

Children begin to develop the skills for causal reasoning and explanation building at a young age, but how these early resources are fostered through schooling is not well understood. My earlier work demonstrated how school-age children constructed explanations for a simple visible system of levers. These studies suggested that even when all components of a mechanism are available for children to see and manipulate they often fail to explain the action of the system in terms of mechanism.  In particular many children struggled to identify components relevant to mechanism, mentally animate the motion of the system, and build causal connections to explain the relevance of interactions within the system. However, my colleagues and I went on to show how careful instruction could help young students begin to understand and reason about these simple mechanisms.

nighorn,"My laboratory focuses on understanding the molecular interactions that underlie the appropriate development and function of the olfactory system. Our current interest is a complete understanding of the role of neuromodulators such as nitric oxide, serotonin, and dopamine. Our ultimate goal is to understand how these neuromodulators affect the antennal lobe and lead to changes in the processing of olfactory cues and olfactory-based behaviors. Our approach is to take advantage of the experimental manipulations and rich electrophysiological and behavioral context available using the moth Manduca sexta as a model. We use optical recording, intracellular recording, multiunit extracellular recording, path clamp recording – both in-vivo and in cell culture – and behavioral assays including upwind flight and proboscis extension olfactory conditioned behaviors to investigate the function and development of the olfactory system.","My laboratory focuses on understanding the molecular interactions that underlie the appropriate development and function of the olfactory system.

nickik,"After earning an MA in linguistics and romance languages from Germany, I started my career as a researcher and educator when I joined the research team of the Third International Mathematics and Science Video Study (TIMSS 1994) at UCLA in Los Angeles, California. My work on this and eventually its larger follow-up study (TIMSS 1999), the first observational studies that compared teaching practices in different countries using large, nationally representative video samples of authentic classroom instruction, prompted my interest in mathematics teaching and learning, interdisciplinary approaches, and research methodology, which led me to earn a PhD in quantitative research methods from UCLA. Those experiences have shaped in many ways how I approach my own research.

It is also during that time that I first became interested in teacher knowledge, specifically usable teacher knowledge, and its relationship to teaching and student learning. It seemed that the videotaped teachers in the different countries not only had different ways of teaching mathematics, but that they also differed in how they understood and interpreted classroom events as they unfolded, which led them to make different instructional decisions. When we asked collaborators (teachers, teacher educators, and researchers) from the different countries to comment on the teaching they had observed in the videotaped lessons from their own and other countries, their comments were surprisingly consistent by country revealing different cultural orientations toward mathematics teaching and learning (cultural scripts), but they also seemed to reveal differences in knowledge. This observation led me to ask whether we might be able to observe similar systematic differences in teachers' analyses of teaching events within a given country, reflecting differences in usable teacher knowledge and expertise. 

During my graduate studies at UCLA and eventually for my dissertation, I developed a prototype measure that consisted of several short, mathematically and pedagogically interesting video clips and asked teachers of different levels of experience and expertise to comment on the observed teaching events. I developed rubrics to score the written responses to obtain measures of usable teacher knowledge and began exploring the relationship of these scores to other measures and criteria. Upon graduation, I moved on to become a research scientist at the LessonLab Research Institute in San Monica, California, where I continued and expanded this work with help of $1.5M funding by the Institute of Educational Sciences (IES) with promising results. We have now more than 120 video clips available for which we have psychometric information and which can be used as measures for research purposes either as existing scales or to custom build assessment scales around specific topics or mathematical ideas of the Elementary and middle school curriculum (www.teknoclips.org).

During my time at LessonLab, I also became interested in teacher value-added scores as another measure of teacher performance and teacher quality and their potential use in teacher accountability and formal teacher evaluation systems. Through a grant by NSF ($1.5M), I was given the opportunity to study their statistical properties in depth and their relationship to instructional quality and curriculum-based measures of student learning. Since joining the University of Arizona, I have continued both my work on usable teacher knowledge by exploring text classification approaches to automatically score teachers' responses to the video clips with additional funding from IES, and teacher value-added scores by developing and applying a observational rubrics of instructional quality to a large set of videotaped classroom lessons. Most recently, with additional funding from NSF, we began exploring automated scoring of our observational rubrics using verbatim lesson transcripts.

minkyukim,"Dr. Kim is an assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arizona from fall 2016.

He earned his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Kyung Hee University in February 2004.  During his undergraduate study, he was recognized with a silver award (2nd prize) at the 14th National Undergraduate Student Competition in Transport Phenomena held by the Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers and graduated with a Dean’s award for his academic achievements.

Dr. Kim moved to the U.S. for his graduate work, where he earned an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering in December 2006 and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science in May 2011 at Duke University.  He was a recipient of fellowships from the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and Medtronic Foundation.  Under the guidance of Prof. Marszalek, his research focused on biopolymer (proteins, DNA) design, synthesis, mechanics and self-assembly for nanostructured molecular materials.  He discovered a unified structure-mechanical property relationship that elucidates the spring-like behavior found in most α-helical spiral-shaped proteins at the nanoscale level.  He also developed a potential fabrication method to hierarchically self-assemble these mechanical proteins into supramolecular structures.  His research was recognized with several awards from Duke University, including the Student Research Achievement Award at the Biophysical Society annual meeting in 2010.

After finishing his doctoral studies, Dr. Kim started his postdoctoral research with Prof. Olsen at MIT.  His research focused on the development of biopolymer-based functional materials for defense applications.  He developed a formulation where self-associated polymeric nanomaterials effectively detoxify chemical warfare nerve agents for environmental decontamination.  He also designed the first synthetic selective filtering biopolymer hydrogel inspired by the nuclear membrane for the development of novel selective filtering materials to detect and remove biological warfare agents, such as SEB, anthrax and botulinum. 

Dr. Kim’s research interests are broadly clustered in the areas of bioinspired/biomimetic materials, biomolecular engineering, soft condensed matter physics and nanoscale biophysics.  He is currently interested in how bioinspired design and biosynthesis can be used for the preparation of novel functional materials, how the nanomechanics of folded biopolymers and artificially engineered hyperbranched biopolymer structures can be translated into the mechanics of macromolecular materials that provide new insight into polymer physics, and how protein sequences can control parameters that regulate the functional properties of polymeric materials. The developed materials will target applications in biotechnology for improving healthcare and national defense.

alfie,"Ph.D., University of Wisconsin, Madison,1995. Professor of Italian. I've been at the University of Arizona since 1997, after teaching for two years at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.  I teach courses in Italian language (all levels), literature, culture and folklore. In 2008 I was honored with a COH Distinguished Teaching Award; the nomination required a ""Statement of Teaching Philosophy,"" which can be read here. 

My research focuses on medieval comic literature, including books on Cecco Angiolieri (2001) and Dante (2011).  This is a field that is vitally important, but frequently misunderstood.  The literature of insult was viewed as a means to reinforce morality by publicizing and chastising people's misbehaviors.  Therefore, it was considered an ethical art; it was called the literature of ""blaming,"" which was juxtaposed to the literature of ""praise"" (for praiseworthy actions and individuals).  My most recent book, Dante's Tenzone with Forese Donati: The Reprehension of Vice (University of Toronto Press, 2011), explores Dante's experiences with this type of poetry.  I recently gave a talk on ""Dante's Poetry of Insult"" for Humanities Week, which fleshes out these ideas further.  It can be viewed here.

In addition, I am the co-editor of a collection of essays in honor of my dissertation advisor, Christopher Kleinhenz (2012).  I have also published numerous articles on medieval literature, including the other comic lyric poets, Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch. Most recently, I have published a translation of the irascible poet Rustico Filippi (ca. 1230-ca.1299). 

From 2010 until May 2015 I was the Department Head of French and Italian.  I was proud to serve in this capacity because during that time, we grew both programs: French reached over 160 majors, and Italian peaked over 100 majors, making it the largest Italian Program in the United States (by the count of Majors).  For more information about our Italian Program, watch the spot done on us in 2009 by Arizona Public Media. 

While I'm proud of my sholarship, I also believe fully in the importance of community engagement.  To that end, I happily work with St. Philips in the Hills Episcopal Church in their annual ""All-Night Reading of Dante's 'Inferno.""""  In 2012 I was interviewed with the Rev. Greg Foraker about the ""All-Night Reading"" on ""Arizona Public Media"" (scroll 20 minutes into the show to see the interview), and in 2014 I was interviewed about the all-night reading on the Bill Buckmaster radio program.

kategrier,"Dr. Grier is an extragalactic observer whose research uses variability in active galactic nuclei (and quasars) to learn about the physical structure and environment within the active nucleus and measure the masses of supermassive black holes. Dr. Grier uses a technique called reverberation mapping to measure light echoes that travel out from the black hole accretion disk into surrounding gas -- this surrounding gas allows us to measure the mass of the supermassive black hole. In addition, the variability of broad absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars can help us learn about outflows that are launched from the quasar accretion disk, which may have the potential to interact with the rest of the galaxy hosting the active nucleus. Dr. Grier is an active member of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration, and is the Co-Chair of the SDSS-V Reverberation Mapping Working Group. Her work uses primarily optical spectra from SDSS in combination with optical photometric data from other telescopes, but she also works with data from other telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope. These data help us measure and improve black hole mass measurements in active galaxies/quasars across the universe so they can be used to examine the evolution of the supermassive black hole population across cosmic time.","Dr. Grier is an extragalactic observer whose research uses variability in active galactic nuclei (and quasars) to learn about the physical structure and environment within the active nucleus and measure the masses of supermassive black holes.

Arch with a Certificate in Urban Design from Rice (1979), Miller worked for several firms in the south before starting his own practice in 1986. An adjunct at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, he taught at Clemson University from 1990-2010, serving as Professor-in-Residence at the Daniel Center in Genoa, Italy (1997-1999) and Director of the Clemson Architecture Center in Charleston (2000-2010). Under Miller’s leadership, the Charleston center won three NCARB Prizes for the Creative Integration of Practice and Education, plus the AIA’s Best Mentoring Practices award. In 2009 he was awarded the ACSA Creative Achievement Award for design/build work. Miller was awarded a fellowship to the American Academy in Rome (1997) for his integrated teaching and practice. He won first prize in the Präsenz der Zeit—2010 competition in Braunschweig, Germany (2004). His artist book, Implementing Architecture (Nexus Press, 1988), won First Place and Grand-Prize in MACWORLD’s graphic design competition (1989) and is the collections of major national art museums. Miller’s pedagogical focus has been “hybrid learning”: merging educational content with professional practices. From urban design to design/build installations, he has developed a teaching method around service-learning. Most of his published scholarship, appearing in Europe, South America, and the US, explores this territory. Since Miller became Director of the School, its Master of Architecture degree has been accredited; the Bachelor of Architecture degree has been ranked by the Design Futures Council in the top-20 nationally for three of the last four years; and the School has adopted the only sustainability protocol in the United States that spans all studios in a degree program.

Presently, we are examining the regulation of Ded1 in translation, both by Gle1 and by post-translational modifications. We are also interested in examining the function and regulation of other DEAD-box proteins. Our research will not only greatly increase our understanding of how these factors function in translation but will elucidate potential mechanisms for control of gene expression, including aiding future studies of functional coupling between mRNA export and translation.","Our research in the Bolger lab has dual goals: 1. addressing fundamental biological questions, and 2. utilizing this knowledge to advance human health.

Her book Forging Arizona (Rutgers, 2019) examines these themes through a bizarre nineteenth-century land grant scheme in which a con artist named James Addison Reavis falsified archives around the world to present his wife as the heiress to a spurious Spanish land grant with the intention of claiming ownership of a substantial portion of the newly-acquired Southwestern territories. Drawing from a wide variety of sources including court records, newspapers, fiction, and film, Forging Arizona argues that the creation, collapse, and eventual forgetting of Reavis’s scam reveal the mechanisms by which narratives, real and imaginary, forge borders.

These chemicals include nutrients, drugs, and toxins with profound implications for our health and for drug design. Our lab focuses on the main systems that our bodies use to recognize and sort these compounds, especially transporters from the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) and Solute Carrier Superfamily (SLC) families using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, and structural biology. These transporters have presented challenges owing to their instability once extracted from our cells membranes. The formulation of new lipid isolation systems, new analytical methods, and powerful new structural biology tools, especially powerful new electron microscopes, have cracked these problems open and present an exciting new forefront in understanding fundamental biology as well as in drug design.","Our bodies face the tremendous task of sorting, organizing, and safely dealing with the millions of small molecules they encounter every day.

bmw99,"Beth Weinstein’s practice and research move between the architectural and the performative, and across scales from drawing to performance-installations to urban interventions, investigating spatial manifestations and invisibilities of political, environmental, and labor issues. Her practice-based doctoral research explored how performances of spatial labor, employing architecture’s instruments (text, drawings and models), can render ‘sensible’ (in)visibilities around architectures of internment. She continues to ask what forms of architecture, and associated invisibilities, are produced through executive order and under states of exception.

Beth has extensively published on performativity in and of public space, theater architecture, and scenography (see publications below). She serves on the advisory editorial board of the Routledge Journal of Theater + Performance Design, and previously served on the editorial board of the Journal of Architectural Education. Building upon her research that resulted in the Collaborative Legacy of Merce Cunningham exhibition (2011-14), she is currently writing a book titled Architecture + Choreography: Collaborations in Dance, Space and Time (Routledge 2022). Through critical texts, photos and original drawings, Architecture + Choreography examines the artifacts and performance events that emerged through fifty collaborations, unpacking the methodologies, concepts, and approaches that pushed the boundaries of participants’ practices.

Beth is a registered architect and founded Architecture Agency in 2002 after more than a decade of practice in the offices of Jean Nouvel, Asymptote, SOM and others. She has coordinated and taught undergraduate and graduate design studios; capstone; critical inquiry; history, theory and techniques of representation; building technologies; and workshop-seminars exploring performance, politics and public space. Recent pedagogical projects explored how urban spaces invisible-ize, how states of exception curtail rights of assembly, and to critically question architecture through the lens of the anthropocene. She has lectured internationally, taught at ENSA Paris-Malaquais, the Ecole Spéciale d’Architecture (ESA), Confluence Institute and Columbia University in Paris, as well as Columbia’s GSAPP, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Pratt Institute, and Parsons/The New School for Design.","Beth Weinstein’s practice and research move between the architectural and the performative, and across scales from drawing to performance-installations to urban interventions, investigating spatial manifestations and invisibilities of political, environmental, and labor issues.

rhenderson,"The semantics of human languages involves complex representations and operations over those representations. The goal of my research is to design logics in which one can define representations and operations over those representations that closely mimic what is observed in human languages. This allows us to then model how people interpret the meanings of arbitrary expressions in the languages they speak. 

To understand how meaning in human languages works in general, we need evidence from a large variety of languages. For this reason my research has a strong empirical component. I have done primary fieldwork on a number of Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala. I work to describe, document, and analyze these languages in their own right, while also discovering what they can tell us about how human languages work in general.","The semantics of human languages involves complex representations and operations over those representations.

sazz,"The Department of Computer science has risen to the many challenges posed last year by the global pandemic.  We are proud of our achievements in both research and education this past year.

The trajectory of the department is quite exciting.  At the start of the Fall semester, the faculty was the largest in the history of the department, with 22 Professors and 8 Lecturers.  As points of comparison, when I joined the department as a Ph.D student in 1990, there were 11 Professors, and when I re-joined as a Professor in 2009, there were 12 Professors and four Lecturers.  Our enrollments are booming, with about 1400 undergraduates and nearly 100 graduate students.  Our students continue to win prestigious awards and fellowships.  More impressively, they have seamlessly adapted to the virtual classroom over the past year.

We were excited to add two faculty members in August.  Sazzadur Rahman joins us as an Assistant Professor.  Sazzadur recently completed his Ph.D at Virginia Tech and specializes in computer security; he joins a strong security group that includes Christian Collberg and Saumya Debray.  Melanie Lotz joins us as a Lecturer.  Melanie holds an M.S. degree from Purdue and was a Lecturer at Purdue for three years before moving here.  Other good news includes three successful promotions: Josh Levine and Carlos Scheidegger to Associate Professor and Beichuan Zhang to Professor.  

The faculty continues to expand the research of the department.  For much of the department’s history, the research profile was one of computer systems and algorithms.  Today, we remain strong in those areas, but our growth has allowed us to add research groups in information visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and high-performance computing.  Research funding is strong, having increased nearly five-fold over the last decade.  Multiple faculty have spun off their research into start-up companies in the last several years.  Faculty winning awards for most influential research included Christian Collberg, Saumya Debray, and Stephen Kobourov.  Additionally, Kate Isaacs recently won the prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER award.

The faculty and students could not have achieved all of this without our fine and dedicated staff.  Martin Marquez (our Director of Academic Services) leads a team of four professional advisors, a graduate program coordinator, a coordinator of career development, and an administrative assistant.   Alicia Cool (our Business Manager) handles the ever-growing grants and contracts for the department, and Eric Collins (Manager of Lab Staff) administers both our teaching- and research-related infrastructure.  

Looking forward to 2021, the department is well-positioned to emerge from the pandemic as a much stronger unit.  Much has been learned about carrying out teaching- and research-related activities remotely.  We should be able to integrate this new knowledge to be even more productive once we are back in person.","The Department of Computer science has risen to the many challenges posed last year by the global pandemic.

grjthatcher,"Greg Thatcher, PhD, joined the University of Arizona in 2020 from the University of Illinois College of Pharmacy. In his career, he has graduated over 50 students with PhD’s and a dozen with MSc’s and mentored 40 undergraduate researchers, the majority while on faculty in the Chemistry Department at Queen's University in Canada from 1988 until 2002. These trainees have proceeded to positions in biotech, pharma, business, education, and academia in the USA, Canada, Europe, India, and China.

While at the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC), Thatcher acted as founder/leader of the Translational Oncology Program in the University of Illinois Cancer Center and co-director of the NIA Predoctoral Training Program in Alzheimer’s Disease & Related Dementia. In 2013, he founded a campus-wide and disease-agnostic drug discovery center at UIC, focused on small molecule drug discovery, which continues to play an active role in academic drug discovery across Chicago. Dr. Thatcher created his first start-up biotech company in 1997, which successfully took an Alzheimer’s drugs into human clinical trials. Thatcher’s trainees receive a multidisciplinary education in modern aspects of medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and chemical toxicology: the underpinning of drug discovery and development. Students who graduate with expertise in synthetic medicinal chemistry will have competency in another area, such as drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics; and students who graduate with expertise in cell/molecular biology or biochemistry will be experts in bioassay design and have competency in drug discovery.

The Thatcher lab’s research has been continuously funded by the NIH since 2003, supported by NCI, NIA, NHLBI, NIAID, and NCCAM, resulting in over 170 publications and dozens of issued patents. Two new chemical entities were licensed and successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer in 2019.","Greg Thatcher, PhD, joined the University of Arizona in 2020 from the University of Illinois College of Pharmacy.

mugmon,"Matthew Mugmon, who served as the New York Philharmonic Orchestra's Leonard Bernstein Scholar-in-Residence for the 2015–16 season, received his Ph.D. in historical musicology from Harvard University in 2013 and taught at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2013) before joining the faculty at the University of Arizona in 2014. He is also a Center for University Education Scholarship (CUES) Distinguished Fellow.

Mugmon's research brings together two strands of recent interest in music history: the study of the transmission, reception, and circulation of music in interpersonal networks, and the development of American musical modernism as a transnational phenomenon. His recent book Aaron Copland and the American Legacy of Gustav Mahler (University of Rochester Press, 2019) offers the first detailed exploration of Copland's multifaceted relationship with Mahler's music and its lasting consequences for music in America. It demonstrates that Copland, inspired by Mahler's example, blended modernism and romanticism in shaping a vision for American music in the 20th century. Mugmon illustrates that Copland's career-long engagement with Mahler's music intersected with Copland's own Jewish identity and with his links to such towering figures in American music as Nadia Boulanger, Serge Koussevitzky, and Leonard Bernstein.

Other publications include recent articles inThe Journal of Musicology, Journal of Musicological Research, Music & Letters, the Grove Dictionary of American Music, Rethinking Mahler, and the volume Ambrosiana at Harvard: New Sources of Milanese Chant, which he edited with Thomas Forrest Kelly. Forthcoming work will be published in The Symphonic Repertoire Series, Volume 5: The Symphony in Europe since ca. 1930 and the Americas (Indiana University Press, ed. A. Peter Brown and Brian Hart). His writing has also appeared in the Boston Globe, Amusicology, program notes for the American Symphony Orchestra, and the blog Unsung Symphonies, which he cofounded with music theorist Frank Lehman.

Mugmon has presented at regional, national, and international conferences, as well as colloquia. He has received grants for his research from the American Musicological Society and Harvard University. His paper ""Making Mahler French: Bernstein's Case for the Composer in 1960"" received the Hollace Anne Schafer Memorial Award from the New England Chapter of the American Musicological Society. In 2012, he served as a panelist in a worldwide discussion, sponsored by the New York Philharmonic Archives, of Leonard Bernstein's tours with the New York Philharmonic. 

In his spare time, Mugmon enjoys running, biking, cooking, playing electric bass, and soaking in the Arizona sun with his wife Madeleine and their sons Owen and Emmett.","Matthew Mugmon, who served as the New York Philharmonic Orchestra's Leonard Bernstein Scholar-in-Residence for the 2015–16 season, received his Ph.D. in historical musicology from Harvard University in 2013 and taught at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2013) before joining the faculty at the University of Arizona in 2014.

hospodar,"Joyce Hospodar, MPA, MBA, has worked as the senior program coordinator of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program since 2001. She is responsible for providing technical assistance in gathering, organizing and presenting required data for rural Arizona hospitals seeking federal designation as a Medicare Critical Access Hospital (CAH) under the Flex program.

Hospodar works on two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HRSA) grants, including the Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Grant, a roughly $500,000 grant that has been awarded to the Rural Health Officeat The University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health every year since 1999. The grant enables the Rural Health Office to assist 14 small rural hospitals in Arizona, which are designated as Critical Access Hospitals. The funds go toward supporting the planning and implementation of health information technology among these hospitals, providing opportunities to enhance the performance improvement of the hospitals, training opportunities for CAH personnel, and improving the emergency medical services (EMS) systems in selected critical access geographic areas.

Hospodar has worked in getting eligible hospitals the CAH designation. Once they are designated, she assists hospitals in projects and tasks that include writing grant proposals, helping with strategic planning for the Critical Access Hospitals and building connections between the hospitals and related organizations in the community. The purpose of this work is to build sustainability for the Critical Access Hospitals, enhance their services and bring better medical care to patients and community, Hospodar said.

We want to foster connectivity within communities and peers around the state and once the Critical Access Hospitals are sustainable, were looking to see how we can move forward from their sustainability, Hospodar said. What were doing is trying to build the infrastructure of these hospitals in rural communities where the hospital is usually the largest employer. If the hospital closes, communities cannot easily draw businesses if they dont have health care. If the communities want to grow, health care has to be there. Its critical for these frontier rural communities.

Recently, the Rural Health Office received a 5 year W.K. Kellogg Foundation grant called Rural People, Rural Policy Initiative. The effort involves energizing and equipping rural organizations and networks to shape policy that will improve the vitality of rural communities and the lives of their residents. Hospodar serves as the Principal Investigator for this grant.

Hospodar has more than 30 years of experience in the health care field focusing on strategic planning, marketing, and operations of community-based programs, including efforts that supported the development of new business strategies, improvement of existing programs, and solicitation of external funds for program enhancement/continuation. She has worked for the Carondelet Health Network in Tucson, the Jewish Hospital Health Network in Louisville, Ky., and HCA St. Marks Hospital in Salt Lake City.

Professor Langer’s interest in environmental economics stems from an observation that—because individual choices have environmental repercussions—policies such as subsidies, regulations, and standards are often crucial for improving environmental outcomes. Building on this observation, her research evaluates how alternative policy approaches will change environmental outcomes by merging theoretical insights with econometric modelling that allows her to recover the drivers of individuals’ and firms’ behavior. Professor Langer studies fundamental forces that affect many industries (for instance, the role of dynamic incentives on policy design and enforcement), major industries with widespread environmental impact (for instance, the use of gasoline for transportation), and econometric approaches to solving research questions faced far beyond environmental economics (for instance, the measurement of policy uncertainty).

Following completion of a dendrochronological fire history study for the National Park Service in Saguaro National Park which resulted in several published papers, he has participated in numerous funded projects at the LTRR. These projects have included a ten-year effort to reconstruct fire in the Sierra Nevada forests funded by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Global Change Program and numerous contracts with the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service to develop dendrochronology-based fire histories. Recent field efforts have included expansion of fire history reconstructions into new geographic areas and the utilization of new, multi-proxy reconstruction techniques. His field collection efforts have resulted in the development, over the past seventeen years, of a new network of millennial-length tree-ring chronologies that are being used in climate reconstructions and as archaeological dating controls. Most recently this has resulted in the development of a new 2,300 year long tree-ring chronology in central Utah.

coeno,"In healthy humans, ventilation is propelled by the rhythmic contraction of the diaphragm, the main muscle of inspiration. In contrast, in patients admitted to the intensive care unit, ventilation is carried out by a machine - to facilitate oxygen uptake in the lungs - and the diaphragm is inactive. However, mechanical ventilation is clearly a two-edged sword: recent studies suggest that during mechanical ventilation the diaphragm rapidly weakens. Thus, prolonged mechanical ventilation may be required because of diaphragm weakness caused by the mechanical ventilation itself. This so-called weaning failure is frequently encountered in ICU patients and contributes to mortality. My laboratory aims to unravel the complex pathophysiology of diaphragm weakness in critically ill patients. We particularly focus on the putative role of titin, a giant mechanosensor protein. For our studies we make use of genetically engineered mouse models and unique diaphragm biopsies of critically ill patients.","In healthy humans, ventilation is propelled by the rhythmic contraction of the diaphragm, the main muscle of inspiration.

dajenkins,"Dr. DeMarcus Jenkins is an Assistant Professor of Educational Policy Studies and Practice. His scholarly research interests draw from his previous experiences as an urban school educator and state-level policy analyst. Dr. Jenkins’ research is focused on the relationship between urban spatial transformation, particularly of neighborhoods and cities, and school reform. Broadly conceived, his research interrogates the dynamic power structures that organize contemporary geographies of education and educational arrangements, including racism, sexism, and racialized capitalism.

More specifically, his scholarly work is comprised of two major strands of research. In the first strand, he explores how demographic, social, cultural, and material changes in cities and neighborhoods (re)shape the character of schools and (re)produce new forms of inequality. This area of research focuses on dynamics external to schools that impact the purpose and nature of schools such as curriculum and pedagogy, school climate and discipline. The second strand of his research concerns a corollary question: how do communities and urban school stakeholders – teachers, administrators, students and parents – respond to and contend with the larger complex forces implicating public schools to make them more equitable and socially just. This line of research explores the interplay of power, resistance, and political possibility to understand how grassroots stakeholders might engage in contesting unjust geographies of education and urban school restructuring.

Working at the intersections of race, place, and policy, Dr. Jenkins leverages empirical and analytical techniques from scholarly traditions in sociology, critical geography, critical policy sociology, urban theory, and critical race theory to investigate questions of school reform and improvement. In doing so, he highlights the implications for historically vulnerable communities along race and class lines. Consistent throughout his research are practical solutions for school leaders and policymakers.

He holds a B.A. in English and African American History from the University of Michigan; a M.A.T in Secondary English from American University; Ed.M from Georgia State University in English Education. In addition, he received his Ph.D from the University of California, Los Angeles in Urban Schooling with an emphasis in Education Policy and Leadership.","Dr. DeMarcus Jenkins is an Assistant Professor of Educational Policy Studies and Practice.

In addition to the representation of femininity and debates on “the woman question,” her research and teaching interests include the history of Russian theatre and performance (from the nineteenth century to the present), and Russian language instruction.

 

Dr. Lucey is author of Love for Sale: Representing Prostitution in Imperial Russia (Cornell University Press, 2021). Love for Sale examines how a variety of writers and their contemporaries working in the visual arts utilized the theme of prostitution to tackle issues of public hygiene, fidelity, and the commodification of sex. As Russians eagerly discussed the nature of sex work, they witnessed the debate expanding beyond the realm of the brothel to include other types of transactional relations haunting the institution of the family. What began as an attack on state-sanctioned prostitution broadened to encompass a huge swath of the female population that survived, and in many cases thrived, by harnessing sexual labor in Russia’s nascent capitalist market. Streetwalkers, demimondaines, kept women, dowerless brides and procuresses all lived and profited by mobilizing sex for financial benefit. While scholars have long been interested in these themes, Love for Sale is the first study to consider commercial sex holistically, as a cultural phenomenon in imperial Russia that dominated discussions related to women’s autonomy.

rreineke,"Robin C. Reineke, PhD is Assistant Research Social Scientist in Anthropology at the University of Arizona’s Southwest Center. Her research centers on the social processes of forensic human identification and disappearance in the southern Arizona borderlands. Early on in her research for this project, Reineke identified an unmet need for thousands of families of missing migrants—they could not easily report a missing loved one on the border, and hence, data that could identify the dead was not making it to forensic scientists. This compelled her to found the Missing Migrant Project in 2006, and then co-found the Colibrí Center for Human Rights in 2013. Reineke’s professional story is one of working at the boundaries—between the U.S., and Mexico, between the disciplines of cultural anthropology and forensic anthropology, and between the academic and nonprofit sectors. Her research and teaching interests include science and technology studies, forensics, humanitarianism, global migration, and human rights along the U.S.-Mexico border. From Seattle, Washington, Reineke received a BA in anthropology from Bryn Mawr College, and a Master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Arizona.

jessewoodson,"Research in my lab will focus on a fundamental question in biology; how do plants sense their environment and adapt? Because they are sessile, plants must use a wide range of sophisticated environmental signaling mechanisms to minimize stress so that they can thrive. Like other eukaryotes, plants can use their energy-producing organelles (i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts) as such sensors. In response to a changing environment or stress, these organelles can emit ‘retrograde’ signals that alter gene expression and/or cell physiology. This kind of signaling is important in plants, fungi, and animals and impacts diverse cellular functions including photosynthesis, energy production/storage, stress responses, growth, cell death, ageing, and tumor progression. Although many retrograde signaling pathways are known to exist in plants and other organisms, the mechanisms they use are poorly understood.","Research in my lab will focus on a fundamental question in biology; how do plants sense their environment and adapt?

smares,"My research focuses on determining the role of Fragile X protein in heart disease. Fragile X has been linked to heart muscle development and function in a variety of animal models. However the molecular role of Fragile X in the heart has yet to be determined. I hypothesize that Fragile X protein, which regulates the expression of many critical proteins, is required during development to regulate structural integrity and proper functional properties. With heart disease claiming about 600,000 lives in the United States alone every year, my goal is to understand how certain proteins, like Fragile X, can contribute to the progression of heart disease and what therapies can be established to reduce the occurrences.","My research focuses on determining the role of Fragile X protein in heart disease.

mfig,"""Keith Allred became the Executive Director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse on January 1, 2019. He was recruited to lead NICD because he had recently launched CommonSense American, a new organization that brings Republicans, Democrats, and Independents together from across the country to find and champion solutions with broad support. Impressed by the successful five-year state pilot, leadership invited Keith to make NICD the platform for CommonSense American and to integrate it with NICD’s other programs to revive civility and enhance problem solving across the partisan divide.
The Common Interest, the state-level pilot organization, operated in Idaho from 2005 – 2009. Its major legislative achievements led the Idaho Democratic Party to make the unusual move of asking him, as an independent, to be their nominee for Governor in 2010.

Prior to returning home to pilot the citizens’ group, Keith became the first professor of negotiation and conflict resolution hired by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. He started his academic career as a professor at Columbia.

Keith has also served in a variety of business leadership roles. Most recently, he was a partner at the Cicero Group, ranked the 12th best boutique management consulting firm in the world by Vault.com. Prior to Cicero, he served as COO of Health Catalyst. Keith’s leadership there played a critical role in attracting a major investment by Sequoia Capital. He is a member of the Board of Directors for Midas Gold, which trades on the Toronto Exchange (TSX: MAX).

Keith earned a PhD in Organizational Behavior from UCLA and BA in American History from Stanford. A fifth-generation Idahoan who grew up working summers on the family cattle ranch, Keith finished eighth in the world standings of the National Cutting Horse Association in 2017 after competing in the World Finals in Fort Worth. He and Christine are the proud parents of Anna (16), Dan (14), and Cate (11). The kids are still deciding if they’ve forgiven their parents for moving them from Idaho to DC this summer.""","""Keith Allred became the Executive Director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse on January 1, 2019.

He currently serves as an Assistant Professor in the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Arizona. He studies Native American education using Indigenous statistics and has expertise in the limitations of collecting and applying quantitative results to Indigenous populations. He carries unique experiences to his research that include a 2010 deployment to Iraq as a platoon leader where he received a bronze star medal for actions in a combat zone. 

From his early adolescence, he traveled to Native nations across the United States to encourage and recruit students to pursue higher educations. During this time, He observed many students succeed and fail to accomplish their postsecondary goals. Considering these experiences, and experiences in students affairs, he recognized contemporary mainstream postsecondary persistence theories diverged from his understandings of influences on Native American postsecondary persistence.

As an Indigenous quantitative researcher with expertise in the limitations of collecting and applying quantitative results to Native American populations, he tends to examine research through tribal critical race theory which contends governmental policies toward Native American focus on the problematic goal of assimilation. This challenge often results in relatively low numbers of Native American voices in comparison to dominant culture voices in quantitative research, but can be overcome through increasing Native American participation in academic and policy discourse, and including Native American voices in quantitative research through Indigenous statistics.

vkligon,"Decision-making can be complex, especially when competing values must be weighed. My early career experience working in the natural foods industry taught me that food decision-making is often fraught. Health, convenience, value($) and cultural/emotional attachments can lead to uncertainty around what values are most important in any given eating/consumption experience. Often, the “best” decision in one realm can be the very worst in another (for instance, the healthiest options may cost the most or take the longest to prepare).

As a graduate student, I became interested in food waste as an unintended consequence of the way that people shop for and consume food. My research on food waste led me to think about the ways that individuals and families manage household resources and the priority given to some values over others in any spending decision. This research connected my two favorite topics: food and household money management (personal finances).

I feel so fortunate that I now get to teach courses in personal finance and food systems. These two topics feel important because they can directly impact student’s lives and the health and sustainability of our communities. I am also fortunate to manage outreach programs for the Take Charge America Institute, including the Take Charge Cats program.

My academic background includes an undergraduate degree from Oberlin College, where I studied Public Policy, and an M.S. in Family & Consumer Sciences from the University of Arizona. I am currently ABD in my pursuit of a PhD in Family & Consumer Sciences. My dissertation research focuses on how couples negotiate food provisioning decisions within their households and how the sharing of decisions may lead to food waste.","Decision-making can be complex, especially when competing values must be weighed.

My first single-authored book, Behind the Gate: Inventing Students in Beijing traces the origins the category of “students,” which has been coeval and coincident with Chinese modernity itself. Through an original analysis of one of the crucial episodes in the historiography—and imagination—of modern China, the May Fourth movement of 1919, I show how the signifier “student” was the result of a historical process. To put it simply, while in China—as elsewhere—there had always been people who studied, the political category of “student” was far from pre-determined and was actually produced through political practice during a particular historical moment.

With my colleague Jadwiga E. Pieper Mooney, I have co-edited De-Centering Cold War History: Local and Global Change (Routledge, 2012).

My second monograph, The End of Concern: Maoism, Activism, and Asian Studies, follows the history of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, an organization of radical professors and grad students, as a way to explore an important moment of transition in the Cold War and to highlight the role of Maoism as a political and intellectual inspiration for activists around the world in the long sixties. You can listen to my interview on the book in New Books in East Asian Studies.

I am currently working on a manuscript on revolutionizing the everyday in Beijing during the Great Leap Forward.

I teach introductory classes on Modern China, Modern East Asia, and Communist China, as well as a courses on “The Global Sixties,” “Comparative World Revolutions,” and “Asia in the World.” In all my courses, by expanding the reading list beyond what are usually considered historical sources, I lead students to look at how history is continuously produced around us and to read everyday materials as potential “archives.”

I was born and bred in Venice, Italy and moved to the US in 1998. When I am not working, I am usually working out or cooking.","I am a cultural historian of twentieth-century China, with a particular focus on political activism and urban space.

caf,"For my PhD in British Columbia [1], I noted evidence that favored an Alpide-style (foreland, not retro- or back-arc) fold-thrust belt origin for the Canadian Cordillera. In an attempt to reconcile my observations with the seemingly contradictory, and widely accepted evidences for retro-arc thrusting associated with magmatism at nearly the same time, I invoke a poorly understood, and apparently sparsely represented style of subduction that involves overturning the subducted plate so that it winds up under itself – hence the term auto-subduction [2]. The theory is based on two key field observations in southern Arizona: 1) an ~75 Ma angular unconformity, deemed insignificant, or nonexistent by others, separates a thin-skinned style “Sevier-like” low-metamorphic grade fold-thrust belt from thick-skinned style “Laramide” volcanic and sedimentary rocks throughout southern Arizona, 2) the combined great abundance of oceanic mantle lithosphere, and paucity of oceanic crustal “clasts” within the Orocopian schists, suggests structurally, that the subducted plate from which they were scrapped was steeply inverted and west-facing, not gently east-dipping. Arizona’s greatest mineral wealth, its porphyry copper deposits, are in my mind the result of North America overriding, or auto-subducting the oceanic “leader” of its own tectonic plate.","For my PhD in British Columbia [1], I noted evidence that favored an Alpide-style (foreland, not retro- or back-arc) fold-thrust belt origin for the Canadian Cordillera.

zhangq1,"My research concerns the constitutive role of language in contexts of social change and globalization. Specifically, my work has dealt with the entanglements of linguistic practice and rapid socioeconomic transformations in the People’s Republic of China. As a country changing from a formerly “destratified” and “decommodified” society to one with the emergence of many social strata and a sweeping consumerism, contemporary China presents an unprecedented testing ground for examining the role of linguistic practice in social-economic-political transformations. Situated within such a context, my work treats language not merely as reflecting or responding to societal changes but as being among the very forces and resources that reconfigure the contemporary social-political landscape of China. I have investigated how linguistic resources are taken up by social agents to effect new social distinctions, to attain access to newly available socioeconomic opportunities, and to contest what is considered the “conventional” and the “legitimate.” Much of my research examines local social actors drawing on not only local resources to engage in stylistic and identity work but also supra-local resources made available through transnational flows of capital, people, ideas and commodities. The approach that I take to investigate the use and meaning of linguistic resources combines ethnographic methods of data collection and interpretation with quantitative methods of locating patterns of linguistic practice. I consider linguistic forms in light of their semiotic context, as part of the material and cultural resources that local social actors employ to forge new styles and identities. I explore the social meanings of linguistic resources as they emerge in the process of their use and bundling with other semiotic resources. I am also interested in studying the social history of cultural forms, including culturally salient linguistic forms.","My research concerns the constitutive role of language in contexts of social change and globalization.

My philosophical approach to science is rooted in some of the ideas percolating in physics: we can’t really define (or “know”) something without understanding how it interacts with all of the other somethings. In SNAP-Ed evaluation, this translates to: When you want to know if, how, or why people, organizations, and communities change, you need to explore how they interact. Common sense? Maybe. But many research and evaluation projects rely on an atomistic approach.","I am a career evaluator with a passion for learning and living.

msalzer,"Tree Rings, Paleoclimate, Environmental Change, and Cultural-Environmental Interaction

Dr. Salzer’s current research involves the construction and interpretation of multi-millennial bristlecone pine tree-ring chronologies. These chronologies provide information regarding past environmental and climate change in western North America and the impact of such change on human and other biotic populations.

This research program investigates the role of climate as a driver of ecosystem variability and environmental change. Dr. Salzer's interests merge techniques from dendrochronology, paleoclimatology, biogeography, and archaeology. These interests center around two connected themes. First, developing long histories of climate variability in western North America. This involves the development of annually resolved, spatially explicit tree-ring based reconstructions of temperature and hydoclimatic variables to identify the range of climatic variability in the system. Reconstructions such as these are an important component of developing informed policies that address the impacts of global warming. They also contribute to understanding the drivers and mechanisms related to climate and environmental change within longer-term contexts. The second research focus centers on the influence of climatic change on the cultural-ecological landscape with particular attention to the response of human societies to change as evidenced in the archaeological record. While each of these themes can be pursued alone, the strength of this approach lies in linking these themes in order to provide a foundation for comparing current evidence for climatic/ecosystem change with changes of the past, and thus the ability to guide and inform plans that address long-term sustainability.","Tree Rings, Paleoclimate, Environmental Change, and Cultural-Environmental Interaction

morales7,"Viewing a variety of narratives through the lens of inebriation imagery, this book explores how such imagery emerges in colonial Peru as articulator of notions of the self and difference, resulting in a new social hierarchy and exploitation. Reading Inebriation in Early Colonial Peru evaluates the discursive and geo-political relevance of representations of drinking and drunkenness in the crucial period for the consolidation of colonial power in the Viceroyalty of Peru, and the resisting rhetoric of a Hispanicized native Andean writer interested in changing stereotypes, fighting inequality, and promoting tolerance at imperial level in one of the main centers of Spanish colonial economic activity in the Americas. In recognizing and addressing this imagery, my research restores an element of colonial discourse that hitherto has been overlooked in the critical readings dealing with the history of sixteenth and early seventeenth-century Andes. It presents drinking as the metaphorical site where Western culture and the New World collide and define themselves on the grounds of differing drinking rituals and ideas of moderation and excess. Narratives such as dictionaries, legal documents, conversion manuals, historical writings, literary accounts, and chronicles frame the context of analysis.","Viewing a variety of narratives through the lens of inebriation imagery, this book explores how such imagery emerges in colonial Peru as articulator of notions of the self and difference, resulting in a new social hierarchy and exploitation.

jadwiga,"My work focuses on Latin American and Gender history, with an interest in the Cold War and the global sixties. My first book, The Politics of Motherhood: Maternity and Women’s Rights in Twentieth-Century Chile (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2009) explores the politics of health and rights through the lens of gender.  I have also co-edited, with Fabio Lanza, Decentering Cold War History: Local and Global Change (London and New York: Routledge, 2013) and, with Tamara Chaplin, The Global Sixties: Convention, Contest and Counterculture (London and New York: Routledge, 2017).

In my current research projects, I seek to explore people’s mobilization for rights (widely defined), their definition of rights, and the political strategies they use to obtain specific rights. I continue to work on transnational women's activism and the forging of global feminisms in the post WWII era. But I also research individual’s strategies to defend specific rights, such as the right to health and health care as well as reproductive rights.

I am in the process of completing the biography of the Chilean physician Benjamin Viel – and use his life as a way to discuss the complex relationships of power that contributed not only to the making of public health systems in Chile and the Americas, but also to the experiences of people - of citizens who may have access to health and health care, or who may not.

Next, I will return to my manuscript titled “Roads they Traveled: The Politics of Chilean Exile in Cold War Germany.” It represents a ""street-level"" history of the Cold War and starts with a detailed analysis of Chilean exile in East and West Berlin. I explore regulatory powers and technologies used by state and military actors in order to retain political control over “dissident subjects” or “subversive” citizens. Viewing the exiles’ political mobilization as a struggle over interpretive power and over (political-national) belonging, I argue that attention to their shifting positions of marginality helps to understand their influence on regulatory powers and technologies and on the military’s regiment of citizenship. We can link the exiles’ individual and collective experiences of exclusion- initiated with the military coup- to the making of new political subjectivities and new political possibilities.

Her graduate work first focused on the implementation of multicultural music education in general music settings and later shifted to informal learning processes amongst African-American children as they occurred outside school settings.

 

In addition to her university teaching experience, Dr. Corso has taught Pre-K general music, choir, band, and orchestra in schools and served in school and district administrative positions. She has directed several community choir and band ensembles and performed—coloratura soprano and trumpet player—in the Phoenix metropolitan area, joining local musicians of Irish and Zimbabwean musics in the Southwest and abroad when possible.

 

This combined background of research, teaching, and community engagement continues to refine her inquiry into multicultural music education and its definition and purpose, especially regarding epistemology, cognition, and philosophy, and has led to her current inquiry into the cultural processes of learning traditional musics and the translation of vernacular practices into formalized music education settings. She focuses on the traditional musics of Ireland and the Irish trad diaspora in the U.S. and Shona mbira dzavadzimu music of Zimbabwe.

He is especially interested in writing policies and practices that increase students' positive emotions, engagement, inter- and intra-personal strengths, and capacities for finding meaning and purpose in life.

Stacey's novels include the award-winning, bestselling Eddie & Sunny (optioned for film by Gunnison Galaxy LLC), The Loneliest, Claws, and The Colorado Sequence. In November 2018, Paradox Studios optioned the screenplay of Eddie & Sunny co-written by Stacey and director Desmond Devenish.

Stacey is co-author of Macmillan Learning's 1st Edition of the Year (2016) An Insider's Guide to Academic Writing published by Bedford/St. Martin's Press. He was a finalist for the 1998 Dell Magazines Award for Fiction, a finalist for the 2004 St. Martin's Press/PWA Best First PI Novel Award, a finalist for the 2011 James Hurst Prize for Fiction, and in 2015 one of the first ten novelists acquired by Amazon Publishing's Kindle Scout | Kindle Press.

Stacey is represented by Allan Guthrie at The North Literary Agency.

Stacey has been an invited guest speaker at universities, conferences, and writers' organizations for more than a decade. One of the most ""downloaded"" fiction writers between 2005 and 2011, Cochran has established a global readership by pushing against norms, embracing new technologies, and by creating opportunities for countless writers around the world.

elkareh,"Dr. El-Kareh’s research is primarily focused on mathematical modeling of cancer treatment and growth, with the aim of using these models to discover ways to optimize treatment, particularly chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy. Other research interests have included applying mathematical modeling to fluid mechanics, blood flow in the microcirculation, and human memory. Her undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado is in chemical engineering, as is her PhD from the California Institute of Technology, where her research studies were in theoretical fluid mechanics. Her work in cancer-related areas is motivated by the potential for mathematical modeling to contribute to cancer research, notably in several key ways: (1) through the ability of such models to consider a wide range of possible treatment combinations, schedules, and doses to to optimize therapy, while experimental studies are more limited in the number of possibilities they can test; (2) through the ability of models to perform virtual “experiments” examining the effects of adding, removing, or quantitatively changing certain system variables, parameters, or mechanisms in ways that might not even be feasible experimentally, to better understand which factors are most important, and (3) through the fact that mathematical models can help test hypotheses and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind tumor growth, response to treatment, and the interaction of tumors with the host. Dr. El-Kareh began her work in cancer research with an interest in modeling tumor response to treatment, including drug transport and effects of the tumor microenvironment. However, she soon realized that a major limitation to such studies was a lack of adequate mathematical models for describing cellular response to drugs, and multidrug or drug-radiation combinations. She found that model predictions could vary widely according to which model was used to describe cellular response, and this led to her interest in cellular pharmacology. With her collaborators she developed more realistic models for the response of cells to widely-used chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel, and then pioneered the “additive damage model” as a way to describe cellular pharmacology of drug and drug-radiation combinations. The additive damage model has been very successful in describing experimental data for a wide range of drug and drug-radiation combinations, and she has extended it to include schedule-dependence. A 2007 paper on paclitaxel-platinum drug combinations introduced a new model, the “cell cycle checkpoint model,” that built on the additive damage concept to include cell cycle effects on drug response. The key point of these models has been to consider cellular damage as a separate variable that changes over time in response to exposure and cellular uptake, efflux, binding, metabolism, and repair processes, and to then consider cell kill as determined by peak damage at a critical point in the cell cycle. This separation of cellular response into damage and response to damage has proven essential for explaining delayed responses (cell death often occurs well after exposure has ended) and responses to combinations, where the kinetics of damage formation from each agent is different, and where perturbations, such as to the cell cycle, caused by one agent can influence response to a second agent. Taken together, these cellular pharmacodynamics models provide a very useful framework for more realistically assessing and predicting cellular response to combinations, and they are an important building block for larger-scale models predicting response to therapy. Work in this area is continuing, including the development of models for response to drug-radiation combinations with fractionation. Another focus of research that evolved from Dr. El-Kareh’s modeling of response to cancer treatment has been the driving question: how does chemotherapy actually cause tumor regression? While chemotherapy does not lead to long-term survival for many cancer patients, it remains an important part of standard-of-care treatment for a substantial fraction of patients, at least functioning to prolong survival or to give palliative relief, and for some cancers such as testicular it is in fact curative. In a number of cases it can lead to partial or even total clinical regression of tumors. The traditional, textbook explanation has been these regressions occur because it kills rapidly growing cells. Yet this explanation is generally inadequate, as has increasingly been realized in recent years. Dr. El-Kareh found in her modeling work that explaining regression with only direct cell kill would require assuming a much larger fraction of actively proliferating cells in a tumor than is substantiated by experiment. This then leaves the very important question: what effects other than direct cell kill are causing tumor regression? The most promising explanations are that chemotherapy alters the tumor microenvironment, that it affects host stromal cells in addition to tumor cells, and that it somehow stimulates the immune system or alters the balance in tumor-immune interactions. Dr. El-Kareh has primarily focused on modeling tumor-immune interactions to seek an answer to the question of the actual mechanisms of chemotherapy action. Two papers with Mark Robertson-Tessi and Alain Goriely from 2012 and 2015 examine tumor-immune interactions of only the adaptive immune system; the latter also considers chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy. These studies point to potential for models to guide the design of such therapies to maximally exploit the immune system’s potential and to thus optimize therapy. More recently, Dr. El-Kareh worked with Applied Math graduate student Victoria Gershuny to develop models of tumor-immune interactions that included the innate as well as the adaptive immune system, and that were particularly aimed at examining the role of the immune system in the FOLFOX treatment regimen, which is widely used for colorectal cancer. This work is still in progress, and has now led to a re-examination of the role of intratumoral T cells. These efforts at modeling tumor-immune interactions have significance beyond understanding chemotherapy, as immune treatments are currently the most promising area of development of new anti-cancer therapies, and chemotherapy is likely to still be used in combination with such treatments at least for a sizeable fraction of patients. An understanding of tumor-immune interactions is sure to have clinical relevance for many years ahead. Most cancers kill patients not by the primary tumor but through widely disseminated metastatic disease, yet most mathematical models do not consider growth or treatment of metastatic tumors. This has led to another area of Dr. El-Kareh’s research. One key question she is investigating is: how does the per-cell rate of metastasis change over time as a tumor develops? She has been using data from the NIH’s SEER database along with mathematical models for metastatic growth to address this question. Another question is how considering the nature of a tumor as a large number of separate nodules rather than a single mass affects predictions for optimal treatment. These studies will also lead to integration of the previously developed immune models with models for metastatic disease, as the immune system not only affects growth and response of individual tumor nodules, but also affects the ability of cells to move to distant locations and colonize. Survival of cancer patients, even for the same tumor size and stage at diagnosis, is adversely affected by age, even when corrected for other age-related factors. While there are a number of possible explanations for this, including under-treatment of older populations or their decreased tolerance for treatment, it appears very likely that age-related changes to the immune system may lie behind this statistical survival difference. Dr. El-Kareh is currently using data from the NIH’s SEER database and extending previously-developed models for tumor-immune interactions to address the question: can age-related changes in the immune system explain decreased survival times for older patients? As a by-product of this work, the models for the immune system that include age effects have the potential to be useful to researchers in other areas, such as those studying how age affects response to infections. In the area of cancer research, these models are aimed ultimately at studying how immunotherapies might be used to improve cancer survival. Dr. El-Kareh’s interests in modeling cancer growth and treatment have also led to developing a mathematical model for the mammalian cell cycle, work that initiated as she advised Dr. Katherine Williams during her doctoral studies in Applied Math. The cell cycle is important for understanding both cancer growth and anti-cancer treatment, as cancer is a disease of cell cycle dysregulation, and numerous widely-used anti-cancer treatments perturb the cell cycle, or are affected in their efficacy by it. As mentioned above in connection with developing models for cellular pharmacodynamics, these perturbations are particularly relevant for optimizing combination treatment, including optimization of schedules of administration. While several models of the cell cycle have previously been proposed, this new model has the desirable feature of involving continuous ordinary differential equations, and of linking cell cycle progression to completion of cell cycle tasks such as licensing, DNA replication, or nuclear envelope breakdown. This linkage is essential, as regardless of levels of cell cycle controllers, the cycle is designed to not progress if a key task remains unfulfilled. A manuscript on this model is currently in progress, and a follow-up study that will extend the model to include coupling with metabolism is planned. The current model explains S phase control (while DNA is replicated) through the inhibition of additional origin firing by currently active origins (areas of replication), which has led to preliminary work on explaining S phase in more detail, with the aim of improving on previous models that explain DNA origin firing in stochastic terms. A seeming conundrum of origin firing is local promotion simultaneous with global inhibition, and the model in development will include this as a new feature to explain how the length of S phase is determined. A final area of interest of Dr. El-Kareh’s is mathematical modeling of human memory, particular the forgetting function. Dr. El-Kareh came upon this accidentally through an interest in online chess problem solving. By using publicly-available data from a chess problem website, she was able to deduce information about the forgetting function, and test various mathematical forms that have been proposed to describe it. This work is ongoing.","Dr. El-Kareh’s research is primarily focused on mathematical modeling of cancer treatment and growth, with the aim of using these models to discover ways to optimize treatment, particularly chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy.

The basis for her epidemiological understanding and concern for illness and injury came at a time when Tucson and Arizona was known nationally for childhood drowning’s; Tucson Fire Department members were responding to 9-1-1 calls for these submersion incidents and they were primarily for children under the age of 5 years old. What they understood about these childhood drowning’s was they were 100% preventable. Through the investigation of predisposing factors, development of curriculum to educate individuals and the community, partnerships with key stakeholders, and the development and adoption of local ordinance’s to regulate and require barriers for pools and spas they were able to successfully impact and reduce childhood drowning’s.",,,,,,,,,,

Heeke’s vision for Arizona Athletics centers around a culture of excellence, a focus on a first-class student-athlete experience, championship-caliber competitive performances in competition and in the classroom; as well as enhancing fan experience and providing a tremendous workplace environment. His drive as a leader of a nationally-elite athletics program also aims to support the University of Arizona in its mission and goals as a point of pride around the nation. Making strategic enhancements in the operation of the athletics department has been Heeke’s calling card for building a thriving and secure foundation for growth and sustainable success.
 
The impact of the Heeke era on Arizona Athletics was immediate with an overhaul of facilities, groundbreaking academic achievements, the elevation of the department’s fundraising to unprecedented heights, and the enhancement of the overall organizational, employee focus and culture.

During the unprecedented challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Arizona Athletics became a national leader in testing, tracing and treatment while overseeing a 2020-21 year that capped unrivaled championship success in a variety of sports as well as in the classroom. The athletics department’s cohesive collaboration with University of Arizona campus partners and the Pima County Health Department not only developed comprehensive re-entry strategies, but also allowed Arizona student-athletes and staff to be a part of a gold standard testing program that reduced cancellations and postponements of competition. The athletics department was able to complete its strategic and phased approach to fan re-entry during the spring and become the first Pac-12 program to announce plans for full capacity for the 2021 season.

By the end of the 2020-21 academic year, Arizona Athletics had posted one of its most successful years as a department with wholesale athletic and academic success across its 21 programs. Arizona Women’s Basketball’s historic run to its first ever NCAA Championship game appearance solidified the program’s position as one of the elite programs nationally. Trips to the Women’s College World Series by Arizona Softball and the College World Series by Arizona Baseball bookended a dominant spring athletically. Those trips to Oklahoma City and Omaha followed the first Sweet 16 appearance ever by Arizona Men’s Tennis and Arizona Women’s Golf becoming the only program in the nation to reach the semifinals of match play at the NCAA Championships in 2018, 2019 and 2021.
